Hymn R&amp;S 134 On Jordan’s Banks the Baptist’s cry Tune: 537 Winchester new

Opening Prayers

Theme Introduction

Lighting three candles on Advent crown

Let all who take refuge in God rejoice;
let them ever sing for joy. 

The candles are lit.
Jesus is the light of the world. 
A light no darkness can ever put out.

Song R&amp;S 522 From heaven you came, helpless babe

Reading: Philippians 4.4-7 read by Aurelia Awuku

4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: rejoice! 5 Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

Song R&amp;S 286 Rejoice in the Lord always (as a round)

Reading:  Luke 3.7-18 read by Alan Yates

7 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptised by him, ‘You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, “We have Abraham as our father.” For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 9 The axe has been laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.’
10 ‘What should we do then?’ the crowd asked.
11 John answered, ‘Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.’
12 Even tax collectors came to be baptised. ‘Teacher,’ they asked, ‘what should we do?’
13 ‘Don’t collect any more than you are required to,’ he told them.
14 Then some soldiers asked him, ‘And what should we do?’

He replied, ‘Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely – be content with your pay.’
15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 16 John answered them all, ‘I baptise you with[b] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptise you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire. 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.’ 18 And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.

07:30 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle 

09:33 - Call to worship
Minister: In our watching and waiting:
All: Come, Lord Jesus.
Minister: In our hopes and fears:
All: Come, Lord Jesus.
Minister: In our stillness and worship:
All: Come, Lord Jesus.
Minister: Come, Lord Jesus, bless and surprise us

10:00 - Hymn 141 Make way, make way

13:06 - Opening Prayers

15:45 18:45 - Introduction: ‘Clear the way’
When cars were first introduced in this country, red flags were required to be carried in advance to clear the way and make sure all was safe
Clearing the way is a theme in Advent thinking about John the Baptist clearing the way for Jesus
John was a strange challenging figure
Looking at my bookshelf makes me thing I could do with clearing it somewhat
When they introduce John, the gospel writers use words from Isaiah


18:55 - Lighting two candles on Advent crown
Reader: We light our first candle, as a sign of our hope in
Jesus Christ. And we light the second candle to give
thanks for the Bible that is a light to guide and
inspire us:

All: God of hope, come to us again this Advent.
May your Word be a lamp to our feet
and a light on our path. Amen.

20:17 - Song MP 1086 Light of the world

23:03 - Introduction to the reading
Who knows where Malachi actually is in the bible?
It only appears once in the 3 year 
Malachi was the last of the 12 minor prophets and the last book in the old testament. From about 450 years before the birth of Christ
Malachi may not be the name of the writer of this book, &quot;malachi&quot; means messenger
The original words were arranged on a scroll by the ancient editor and as the words were a message, it's thought this led to the nickname
At his time he was exhorting people to change their ways, warning them of the judgement to come.

25:19 - 26:29 - Reading: Malachi 3. 1-4 NIVUK 
3 ‘I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me.
Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple;
the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,’ says
the LORD Almighty.
2  But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when
he appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s
soap.  3  He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify
the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the LORD will
have men who will bring offerings in righteousness,  4  and the
offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the LORD, as
in days gone by, as in former years.

Music for reflection (Be still for the presence of the Lord)

27:45 - 31:17 - Reading: Luke 3.1-6 NIVUK read by Olive Shepherd (seated)
3 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar – when
Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his
brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias
tetrarch of Abilene –  2  during the high-priesthood of Annas and
Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the
wilderness.  3  He went into all the country around the Jordan,
preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  4  As
it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:
‘A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
“Prepare the way for the Lord,
    make straight paths for him.
5  Every valley shall be filled in,
    every mountain and hill made low.
The crooked roads shall become straight,
    the rough ways smooth.

6  And all people will see God’s salvation.

31:25 - Hymn 137 Hark the glad sound

34:06 - Prayer
34:36 - 46:56 - Short Address
Are we prepared to be surprised this Advent season?
Ready to find God at work where we thought he was absent, to find him in unexpected places
Luke tells us to expect the unexpected
The reading starts with the messy world of politics and power
Luke reminds his readers who is in power
When he introduces John the Baptiser he also tells us who is in power
It's this messy, conflict ridden world that God sends his message into
So here we have a world of power, conflict and tension
We are then shifted to the wilderness, a place with no rules
God's power is very different to human power and authority
It brings transformation, hope and new beginnings

46:57 - 48:28 - Prayer
48:52 - Prayers for others

53:35 - Hymn MP 1201 Longing for light

58:10 Offering of bread and wine and Offering Prayer
We invite you to share in the bread and wine at church (or at
home) united in the name of Christ.
Thanksgiving Prayer and Lord’s Prayer
Distribution of bread and wine (Music during distribution)

11:45 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (elder)

12:46 - Introduction and Call to worship
Psalm 93 v 1-5
The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty;
the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength;
indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
Your throne was established long ago;
you are from all eternity.
The seas have lifted up, LORD,
the seas have lifted up their voice;
the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
Mightier than the thunder of the great waters,
mightier than the breakers of the sea –
the LORD on high is mighty.
Your statutes, LORD, stand firm;
holiness adorns your house
for endless days

15:07 - Hymn MP13 All hail the power of Jesus name

18:01 - Opening prayers and the Lord’s prayer

21:21 - Reading Revelation Ch 1 vv 4b – 8 

23:05 - 25:45 - Introduction to theme of the service
What if I told you that on this piece of paper I had every word in the bible, every word ever spoken?
God is like an A-Z, the beginning and end of everything
God has always been
God is at this very moment now
God will always be forever
God's kingdom is wherever Jesus reigns in our hearts

25:59 - Hymn MP 207 Hallelujah sing to Jesus

29:52 - 30:48 - Reading John18 vv 33b – 37 

Young people leave for their group

31:44 - Hymn R&amp;S 638 Thy kingdom come o God

34:25 - 48:13 - Address
Here we are at the end of another Christian church year
Next week is the start of advent
Today is when we remember Christ the King
This festival is not an ancient one in the calendar
Only established in 1925 by Pope Pious the 11th when Europe was in chaos, inflation was rampant and the seeds of the forthcoming disaster were being sowed
The conversation from John's reading allows John to pronounce that Jesus is a king with divine authority
Too often truth is often what power says it is
Jesus defied logic by the way he lived and taught
Teaching that truth is the cornerstone of a decent society

48:21 - Hymn R&amp;S 522 From heaven you came helpless babe

52:46 - Prayers of intercession

56:33 - Hymn R&amp;S 262 Crown him with many crowns

What was special about Sunday, 31st October, 2 weeks ago
A 25 hour day - what did you do with the additional hour?
Darker earlier in the day
Different shades of light and dark
Close your eyes and cover them to experience the darkness
Remembering the dark times of war

Being able to meet family again

46:18 - Prayer 
47:30 - 01:00:18 - Sermon – “Promises, promises!”
The gospel reading talks about war.
It follows on from Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem but we know it comes before the darkest of dark times when Jesus was crucified
The disciples comment to Jesus about how magnificent the temple stones were.
12m long, 4m deep and 6m high, huge pieces of stone that look as if they will be there for ever
Jesus disabuses the disciples of this saying the stones will collapse and every stone will be thrown down.
A shock to the disciples
Jesus is anticipating the destruction of Jerusalem in AD70
Jesus gives the disciples some of the signs of the end of the age
Jesus makes it clear that they should not worry but to watch and be prepared.
Promises made and promises kept?  Do our politicians keep their promises?
COP26 in Glasgow, what promises have been made and which will be kept
Greta Thunberg and &quot;Blah, blah, blah&quot;

A glorious autumn day, the leaves are falling but taking their time

Those who died in conflict
The planet on which we depend
No-one if forgotten by God
The ribbons from the gate to remember loved ones

Listening to Nunc Dimitus

Close your eyes for a few moments and imagine you are blind
How will you survive, how will you work, how will you move around.

Lines from the reading from Mark
The striking contrast in the reading, a great multitude and a lone individual
It is impressive to see Jesus turn his attention from the crowd to the one.

This narrative comes with pertinence for a generation that acts on multitudes and quantities

Sight Loss Sunday is a new initiative from Torch Trust. It has two main purposes: 
• To raise awareness of the prevalence of sight loss in church and local community. 
• To encourage Christians to nurture the unique gifts, talents and abilities that people with sight loss can bring to church life. 
Torch Trust believes that all people with sight loss have a valuable part to play in churches and Christian communities, and Sight Loss Sunday is designed to equip us to live out these values in our own congregation.  Founded in 1959, Torch Trust offers Christian products and services to improve the lives of people with sight loss. They offer Bibles, hymn books and a whole variety of publications in a range of accessible formats including braille, large print and audio. They contribute to RNIB Connect Radio with &quot;Reflections&quot; which airs on a Sunday morning.   They also offer a range of bespoke Christian holidays for people with sight loss.  Their &quot;Sight Loss Friendly Church&quot; initiative offers training, support and advice to churches of all denominations who wish to be more inclusive of people with sight loss.  They provide regular training sessions and catch-up sessions online.

Both Trinity and Cores End Churches are registered as Sight Loss Friendly Churches and we want to do everything we can to include all people, whatever their abilities, in the life and work of the church.  For more information please speak to Sue after the service or visit the Torch Trust website:

   <media:description>00:00 - Music and notices before worship

15:49 - Welcome
17:24 - Prayers for peace in our world and lighting of the peace candle
18:45 - Song - God of Glory
21:24 - 22:28 - Prayers
22:36 - Talk - What does beginning mean to you
What new beginnings have you made?
Life is not easy at the moment
Not easy for children finally being back in school
Not easy for people with medical needs delayed
Life is for new beginnings
Are you beginning anything new at the moment - a new book, puzzle or TV series
Beginnings in the world of nature - snowdrops and daffodils
Last week in the Church calendar we move from Christmas to epiphany.
Today we focus on the baptism of Jesus
26:06 - 27:15 - Reading Genesis Ch1 vv1-5
27:20 - Song - As the sun rises on a new day
31:58 - Meditation
Some of you will have been doing jigsaws over the Christmas period
A meditation on a jigsaw puzzle to reflect on our own lives and how the jumble of pieces is brought together
34:44 - Prayer
35:19 - Talk
The picture of Christ knowing he is loved by God and pleasing to him
35:47 - Reading - Mark 1, 1-11
38:17 - 50:11 - Talk
The news this week has been increasingly grim:  Spiralling COVID numbers, schools closed a day after opening, a new lockdown, events in America. We won't want to see another week like that any time soon
There may be hope behind the headlines - the vaccination programme increasing, education continuing, American democracy has survived
Our reading is all about new beginnings
In just 11 verses, Mark takes to the declaration of Jesus as the son of God.  Nothing about the birth, his focus is the baptism where Jesus begins his ministry and &quot;goes public&quot;
Three aspects of that baptism: Jesus was baptised alongside the crowd of ordinary people, Jesus was baptised by John, that great prophet of the old testament, and Jesus was baptised by the spirit.

50:15 - Prayers of intercession
54:17 - Song - Brother, Sister, Let Me Serve You
57:13 - 57:42 - Blessing

What is the YMCA
Founded by George Williams, came from a farming family but was sent off to the nearest town to learn the cloth trade.
Challenged by the long hours, low pay and lack of care in the workplace he felt the Lord had restored him and wanted him to help young men experience the benefits he had.
2 introductory videos.
Why people become homeless, how the YMCA helps get them back on their feet, working with Wycombe Homeless Connection to be the next stage of the journey back to independence



33:43 - Song -  All I once held dear MP799

37:07 - Introduction to Bible readings

Readings:  Matthew 9:9 
Matthew 25:31 – 40 



Matthew 28:16 – 20 
read by Sarah and Samuel Evans

40:35 - 01:03:26 - Address
Thinking about &quot;calling&quot;
What comes to mind when you think about being called?
Batman? With the boy wonder Robin by his side
A shining light in the sky alerting them to need
Our political leaders have been setting out their stalls at the party conferences wanting people to heed their calls
#BuildBackBetter #GettingOnWithTheJob
Jesus' call is not like any of these, he is claiming to be the Messiah
A simple message - &quot;follow me&quot;.  Not &quot;because this or that&quot;, just &quot;follow me&quot;
Jesus isn't like any earthly leader, dying and coming back to life , an eternal change
Remember that Jesus himself was homeless, not nice lunch after the service.  He needed the help and care of others to live, sleep and eat.
Being called to love and serve others

01:03:28 - Hymn -  I the Lord of sea and sky MP857

01:08:32 - Offering prayer (we offer all that has been given for God’s work this week)

Built into places of worship
But still lifeless on their own
Today we are talking about the miracle of living stones
A paradoxical picture
This reminds me of Lithops - the tiny plants that look like stones
Peters reference to living stones in the reading indicating Jesus
Jesus who is placed in a tomb then raised back to life by God, the cornerstone of life

57:05 - Affirmation (from the URC Statement):
Held together in the Body of Christ
through the freedom of the Spirit,
we rejoice in the diversity of the Spirit’s gifts…
We affirm our intention to go on praying
and working, with all our fellow Christians,
for the visible unity of the Church
in the way Christ chooses,
so that people and nations
may be led to love and serve God
and praise God, more and more, forever. Amen.

Getting back to singing in Church has been great
Psalms are the great hymn-book of the bible, prayers and poetry for believers
150 hymns or prayers
Huge variety from lament to joy
Jesus sang psalms with his his disciples and then references Psalm 22 when on the cross, finally commending himself into his father's hands using psalm 31
At the reformation there was a desire for all to sing the psalms
Psalm 23 inspired many people, George Herbert, Isaac Watts and Henry Baker

Why do we like to reminisce about things from our younger days
40 years ago we used to have a chanted Psalm every week at Trinity
The history of the psalms
Some bible texts requiring rewriting during the reformation
Erasmus wrote he would have certain passages from Paul translated so that &quot;not only Scots and Irish could understand them but Turks and Saracens might read them as well&quot;



53:55 - Hymn I to the hills will lift mine eyes



56:08 - 58:39 - Reading: Philippians 2. 1-11 (NIVUK)

Psalm 116 says ‘What can I offer the LORD for all his goodness to
me?’. We keep a moment of quiet to reflect on what we can offer
for God’s work today…
We offer our gifts to you, Lord of all life
Our gifts of money for your work
the gift of music and poetry for your praise
and the gift of our lives for the work of your kingdom.
To you be glory for ever and ever. Amen
