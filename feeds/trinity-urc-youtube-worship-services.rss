Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. 45 When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. 46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. 48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, ‘Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.’
49 ‘Why were you searching for me?’ he asked. ‘Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?’[a] 50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

Have mercy on us, forgive us our sins,
and restore us to newness of life; 
through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.

26:49 - Hymn - Be still for the presence of our Lord

29:59 - 43:32 - Short Address 
Reflecting on what it means to be human from a faith perspective.
Psalm 8, which contrasts human insignificance with God's mindfulness of humanity.
The destructive aspects of human behavior, including environmental damage and war.
Jesus' welcome of children is highlighted as a radical act in its historical context.
The praise of children is presented as a powerful force against evil.
The psalm speaks of humanity being crowned with glory and honor by God.
Jesus is described as the truest human, who has shared in human suffering.
The creation of a new human family through Jesus' grace is emphasized.
Being human involves recognizing our insignificance while also embracing our God-given dignity.

This sermon explores the complex nature of humanity through a Christian lens, drawing on Psalm 8 and the teachings of Jesus. It grapples with the paradox of human insignificance in the face of the universe's vastness, while also affirming the unique value and responsibility God places on humanity. The speaker addresses both the destructive capacities of humans and their potential for compassion and praise. Jesus is presented as the model of true humanity, offering a path to a new family united by divine grace. The sermon concludes by defining being human as a balance between humility before God and the honor of being part of God's creation, with the communion table serving as a symbol of this united humanity.
