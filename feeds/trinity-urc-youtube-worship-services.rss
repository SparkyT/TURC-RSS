Reflecting on what it means to be human from a faith perspective.
Psalm 8, which contrasts human insignificance with God's mindfulness of humanity.
The destructive aspects of human behavior, including environmental damage and war.
Jesus' welcome of children is highlighted as a radical act in its historical context.
The praise of children is presented as a powerful force against evil.
The psalm speaks of humanity being crowned with glory and honor by God.
Jesus is described as the truest human, who has shared in human suffering.
The creation of a new human family through Jesus' grace is emphasized.
Being human involves recognizing our insignificance while also embracing our God-given dignity.

It grapples with the paradox of human insignificance in the face of the universe's vastness, while also affirming the unique value and responsibility God places on humanity. The speaker addresses both the destructive capacities of humans and their potential for compassion and praise. Jesus is presented as the model of true humanity, offering a path to a new family united by divine grace. The sermon concludes by defining being human as a balance between humility before God and the honor of being part of God's creation, with the communion table serving as a symbol of this united humanity.

Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. ‘I am willing’, he
said. ’Be clean!’ Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. Then

yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a
testimony to them.

Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus travelled along the border
between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten
men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called
out in a loud voice, ‘Jesus, Master, have pity on us!.
When he saw them, he said ‘Go, show yourself to the priests.’ And
as they went they were cleansed.
One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back in a loud
voice. He threw himself at Jesus feet and thanked him – and he was
a Samaritan.
Jesus asked, ‘Where not all ten men cleansed? Where are the other
nine? Has no one returned to give praise to God except this
foreigner? Then he said to him, ‘Rise and go; your faith has made
you well.

40:16 - 43:18 - HYMN R&amp;S 353 There’s a wideness in God’s mercy

43:25 - 52:51 - Short Address
Questions are an integral part of faith and shouldn't be denied.
The Christian journey involves asking big questions without fear.
Hebrew scriptures lacked punctuation, leaving room for interpretation.
Questions can be asked with different intentions - some seek answers, others make points.
Open-mindedness is crucial when asking questions in faith.
The sermon explores various types of questions in biblical passages.
God asks heartfelt questions to humanity through prophets.
The prophets convey God's longing for people to return to Him.
Micah's question &quot;What does the Lord require of you?&quot; is central to the sermon.
The sermon concludes with three key actions: act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.

52:57 - 54:44 - Affirmation based on Micah 4. 2 – 5
Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
to the house of the God of Jacob;
that God may teach us his ways
and that we may walk in his paths.
God shall judge between many peoples,
and shall arbitrate between strong nations
They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
and their spears into pruning-hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.
All shall sit under their own vines and under their own fig
trees, and no one shall make them afraid;
for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.
For all the peoples walk, each in the name of their god.
We will walk in the name of the Lord our God
for ever and ever.

56:07 - 01:04:09 - Prayers of intercession using TP 75 Peace I give to you

01:04:10 - Offering Prayer
God of all life,
You do not desire the sacrifice of animals or rivers of oil,
but rather justice and loving kindness.
So help us by your Spirit,
to practice justice and fairness
to love kindness and compassion
and to walk each day humbly with you,
our Gracious God and the God of all life.
We pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.

12:44 - 14:40 - Prayer of Confession and Assurance of Forgiveness
We come before God held in the knowledge we are loved,
and with assurance that we are transformed through
God’s love.
Loving shepherd, we come to you to confess
That there are times when we live like sheep without a
shepherd. Times we allow our busyness to drive us from
places of rest.
Times we choose paths of discord rather than loving
kindness.
Times we embrace despair rather than hope
Jesus is the good shepherd who has pity on his flock
And promises goodness and love will be with us
Follow your shepherd on the right paths,
And do so in the knowledge you are loved and forgiven.
Amen.
