29:10 - 30:32 - Introduction to today’s readings

36:26 - HYMN R&amp;S 264 He is Life (vs 3 and 4) sung seated

37:54 - 46:53 - Short Address
Different people in the church have varying reactions to the coronation ceremony.
Some appreciate the colorful uniforms, vestments, and rituals, while others prefer something simpler.
There is a mix of emotions, including discomfort when the ritual becomes disconnected from Jesus on the cross.
King Charles, like any human being, experienced nervousness and anxiety during the anointing.
The greater truth of the ceremony is that Jesus is exalted above all, and every knee should bow to him.
The readings draw us into the wonder of who Jesus is and how he brings us to the Divine reality.
&quot;God Save the King&quot; reminds us that we all need saving, and God has a part to play in our nation.
King Charles has a representative role that goes beyond politics and arguments.
The speaker hopes that King Charles will preserve the nation's laws and diversity.
The letter of Peter reminds us to draw spiritual sustenance from God's love.
The sharing of the Lord's Supper reminds us that we all need sustenance and to draw close to God.
We carry burdens on our shoulders, but we can come to God's table to be sustained.
The Lord is good, and we can taste that goodness and carry it with us.
All the time, God is good, and we can draw close to Jesus to experience his goodness.

46:57 - 51:51 - Prayers for the world, our nation and each other
Lord in your mercy  hear our prayer.

52:19 - 54:50 - HYMN R&amp;S 474  Brother, sister

ALL  Lord Jesus, we thank you for the gifts

and the love you have poured into our hearts.
We thank you for the nation, of which we are 
Part, and the peace and freedom we enjoy.
We thank for the promise of your kingdom,
where justice, truth and compassion 
will flow like a mighty river.
Use our praying and living, this and everyday
for the work of Jesus, here and now,
caring, healing and restoring our world.  Amen.

09:13 - Entry of the Bible  

09:17 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle

10:45 - Call to worship
Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth.
Worship the LORD with gladness;
Come before God with joyful songs.
Know that the LORD is God.
It is God who made us, and we are his; ;
we are God’s people, the sheep of his pasture.
Enter God’s gates with thanksgiving
and his courts with praise;
Give thanks to God and praise his name.
God’s love endures forever.

11:31 - 13:15 - Hymn - I will enter his gates (sung twice)

13:23 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

15:46 - 24:54 - Introduction for all ages: ‘Recognise that voice?’
Missing Easter at Trinity due to scheduling conflicts.
During Good Friday, the church had stations of prayer, including one titled &quot;The Buried Grain,&quot; where people were invited to plant a pinch of seed into a tray of soil.
This links to the Bible verse where Jesus compares his death to a buried grain that produces new life.
The speaker sees the growth of the planted seeds as a symbol of Jesus' love within us, reverberating down the centuries and producing fruit in the lives of billions of people.
The Bee Squared program (https://zeroch.org/bee-squared/) that encourages people to plant wildflowers to support bees and other insects crucial to life.
Jesus is referred to as the Good Shepherd and the gateway to God's loving presence.
Jesus' sheep recognize and trust his voice, and the speaker asks the audience to think of a voice they trust, like Mary Berry's recipe or Winston Churchill's wartime speeches.
There are many voices out there today, and the speaker urges the audience to choose which voices they trust.


Reading: John 10.1 – 10 NIVUK read by Kitty 

27:49 - Prayer
Lord you are the Way – help us to follow.
You are the truth – help us to listen.
You are the Life – refresh our lives today. Amen.

28:24 - 30:23 - Hymn - Jesus stand among us

30:44 - 31:33 - Reading: Psalm 23 NIVUK read by Kate 

31:41 - 39:44 - Meditation on the 23 rd Psalm – ‘being a follower of the Good
Shepherd’ (using Stuart Townend sung version MP 1008)
Sing verse 1
Leader: Let us think about how Jesus leads us in times past
and in the present time. (pause) Let us think about the life
Jesus offers us, life in abundance.
(pause, then sing the chorus)
Sing verse 2
Leader: Let us think about and receive again the inner peace
offered by Jesus. (pause) Let us think about and receive again
the contentment Jesus offers.
(pause, then sing the chorus)
Sing verse 3
Leader: Let us think about Jesus’ presence in difficult times
holding before him our troubles and concerns. (pause) Let us
think about drawing closer to Jesus and receiving his love and
protection from harm.
(pause, then sing the chorus)

40:21 - 41:26 - Reading: John 10.11 – 16 NIVUK read by Kitty

42:06 - 43:17 - Hymn The King of love vs 1 and 6 only -sung seated

43:54 - 56:30 - Address
The Great &quot;I ams&quot;
Jesus describes himself as &quot;I am&quot; seven times in John's Gospel.
Each description (&quot;I am the Good Shepherd,&quot; &quot;I am the bread of life,&quot; etc.) takes us into the heart of who Jesus is.
&quot;I am&quot; is not just a personal description but echoes God's words to Moses in the desert.
In John's Gospel, &quot;I am&quot; is linked to the fundamentals of life.
The Shepherd lies down in front of the entrance and protects the sheep through the night.
This intimate picture of the Shepherd is full of trust and care.
Jesus is the Good Shepherd who knows us through and through and wants to protect and keep us safe.
The Gate is the cross, where Jesus protects, leads, and opens up heaven and God's love to us.
Jesus is both the king of kings and the outcast, the one who is poor and rejected.


56:44 - 58:33 - Hymn- All heaven declares

58:41 - 01:05:55 - Prayers for the world with the response
God of truth and love,
bring them abundant life.

01:06:14 - 01:09:32 - Hymn - Christ is the King! O friends rejoice

01:09:33 - 01:09:58 - Closing blessing

How long ago did you last play hide and seek?
Jesus walking with the disciples, hidden in plain sight.
Jesus was not noticed by the disciples when he was walking with them.
We can sometimes be so focused on our own problems that we don't see the miracles or the ordinary everyday things that are right in front of us.
We should pray that God will open our eyes and our hearts to see him in ways that we don't expect.

We all make plans
Sometimes plans don't go as expected.
It can be difficult to deal with unexpected events.
Faith in God can help us deal with unexpected events.
The story of the Road to Emmaus shows how Jesus can come alongside us in unexpected ways.
We should be open to expecting the unexpected.
We should pray for those who are struggling.
We should have faith in God, even when things don't go our way. The story of the Road to Emmaus shows how Jesus can come alongside us in unexpected ways, and give us hope when we are struggling. We should be grateful for God's presence in our lives, and pray for those who are struggling. We should renew our commitment to discipleship, and live our lives in a way that honors God.
Have faith in God, even when things don't go your way.

14:17 - 19:21 - Hymn  R&amp;S 232 Christ the Lord is risen today

19:27 - Opening Prayers

22:04 - 24:40 - Reading: John 20. 1 – 18 NIVUK 

24:53 - 30:04 - Talk for all ages
Eggs have been given during this time of year before Christianity because it represents new life in spring.
Jesus' new life is different from a physical life because he is outside of time and space.
To change and experience new life, one must break out of their shell, just as a chick must peck out of an egg.
God calls us to live a loving life and trust in Him, which may require breaking out of our old habits and fears.
Jesus has already broken through death and sin, and through Him, we can find a new life.
The Easter message is that Jesus' resurrection brings new life and the possibility of eternal life.

30:14 - 32:44 - Hymn R&amp;S 246: The day of resurrection

33:12 - 34:46 - Reading: Acts 10. 34 – 43 NIVUK read by Sarah and Samuel Evans

35:01 - 37:51 - Hymn R&amp;S 250 The strife is o’er, the battle done

37:57 - 46:11 - Address
The power of first impressions.
A TV advert that illustrates the importance of getting the full picture before making judgments.
First impressions can lead to error and prejudice.
The Easter story and the power of first impressions.
Mary Magdalene's initial impression upon finding the empty tomb was reasonable.
Peter and John rushed to verify Mary's report but only saw that the body was gone.
Mary stayed at the tomb and encountered Jesus again.
The wonder and mystery of the Resurrection are beyond human understanding.
Waiting on God and risking vulnerability can lead to a deeper understanding of truth.
The truth of the Resurrection is that Jesus Christ is risen.

46:26 - 50:28 - Hymn - R&amp;S 107 The love of God comes close

06:13 - Welcome 
07:30 - Introduction and call to worship (from Isaiah 53 and John 1.29)

He was despised and rejected  a man of suffering and
acquainted with grief; he was despised, and held of no
account.

All: Yet he was wounded for our transgressions,
crushed for our iniquities;

Upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by
his bruises we are healed. All we like sheep have gone
astray; we have all turned to our own way,
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

Behold the lamb of God who takes away
the sin of the world.
Thanks be to God for the cross of Christ,
Sign of God’s love for the world.
We offer our thanks and praise
this good and holy day. Amen.

08:20 - Introduction: ‘Across the world today – water and crosses’
Palm crosses are a symbol of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem because they are made from palm leaves, which were used to welcome Jesus into the city.
Palm crosses are a symbol of victory because they represent Jesus' victory over death.
Palm crosses are a reminder of Jesus' suffering and death because they represent the cross that Jesus was crucified on.
Palm crosses are a symbol of hope and new life because they represent Jesus' resurrection.
Palm crosses can be recycled or composted because they are made from natural materials.
WaterAid is a charity that provides clean water and sanitation to people in need around the world.
Sado is a girl from Ethiopia who had to walk five hours to collect water every day because she lived in a village that did not have access to clean water.
Malala is a girl from Madagascar who can now go to school because of a water tap in her village. The water tap was installed by WaterAid.
Palm crosses are a symbol of our connection to the world church and to people in need around the world because they are made by people in Tanzania and used by Christians all over the world.

Introduction to the reading

Reading: Philippians 2.5-11 NIVUK read by Norma
 
44:38 - 46:15 - Hymn - My song is love unknown (vs. 1 and 2 only)
46:25 - Prayer

46:56 - 55:33 - Short Address
You don't need a long sermon, you just need a Palm Cross to connect you with the world church
A palm cross connects us with the World Church and with the crowd that welcomed Jesus on Palm Sunday.
The crowd that welcomed Jesus was a mixture of people, some curious, some caught up in the Jesus movement, and some who wanted something new.
Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was a protest against the way things were, with Roman and religious authorities pressing down on the people.
Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was also a celebration of an alternative way of life, based on love and justice.
The crowd welcomed Jesus with palm branches and cloaks, symbolizing their willingness to lay down their lives for him.
Jesus's death on the cross was a sacrifice for the sins of the world and a victory over hatred and division.
We are called to follow Jesus's example of humility, love, and forgiveness.
We are called to work for justice and peace in the world.
Palm Sunday is a time to reflect on the meaning of Jesus's life and death and to commit ourselves to following him.
Palm Sunday is a time to celebrate the hope and joy that Jesus brings to the world.

23:11 - 27:20 - Introductory Talk
What makes us human?
What helps bring people down to earth?
What makes people human is their ability to connect with others and to show compassion.
We are all connected, even if we don't always feel it.
We should never underestimate the power of a simple act of kindness.
The Queen, Tony Blair, and the Bishop of Birmingham are all examples of how humanity can be seen in everyday life.
The story of Lazarus shows how Jesus' humanity intrudes in the most interesting way.
Jesus is not just a divine being, but also a human being who can understand and empathize with our suffering.
We should always strive to connect with others and to show compassion.
Even the smallest act of kindness can make a difference in someone's life.
We should never forget that we are all human and that we should treat each other with respect and dignity.
The world would be a better place if we all made an effort to be more human.

33:37 - 39:17 - John 11: 1-45 read by David and Valerie Bishop
Reader 1 verses 1-7, 17-27,38-46
Reader 2 verses 7-16, 28-37

39:43 - 41:55 - Hymn R&amp;S 518 Father, I place into your hands

42:02 - 56:45 - Sermon (followed by time of quiet reflection)
The story of Lazarus is a story of hope, as it shows that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of resurrection.
Jesus is human and experiences grief, as he weeps for Lazarus. This shows that Jesus is not just a divine being, but also a human being who can understand and empathize with our suffering.
Jesus is the resurrection and the life, as he raises Lazarus from the dead. This shows that Jesus has the power to overcome death and bring new life to those who believe in him.
The story of Lazarus is a sign of God's glory, as it shows that God is powerful and can bring new life out of death.
We should raise our awareness of signs of hope, as there are many things in the world that give us hope, even in the midst of difficult times.
We should empower our community to do the same, as we can all work together to spread hope and light in the world.
We should wait patiently for the resurrection, as we know that one day Jesus will return and make all things new.
We should not be afraid to weep, as it is natural to feel grief when we lose someone we love.
We should trust in Jesus, as he is the only one who can truly give us hope and life.
We should believe in the resurrection, as it is the foundation of our faith and the hope of our salvation.

12:37 - 16:14 - Introduction: How do you pray? How do you see, imagine or

Thinking about how we picture God on Mothering Sunday.
Different names for God, such as Lord Almighty, King of Creation, and Alpha and Omega.
God is referred to as our Father in Heaven and Father of All.
Jesus is a way to think about who God is.
God is described as a friend, savior, and someone to speak to.
There are many ways to think about and pray to God.
Love is a key aspect of God's nature.
If our picture of God is not loving, we are missing the mark

16:16 - Introduction to the reading

17:31 - 18:20 - 1 st Reading: Psalm 131 (The Message) read by Jeany Bien

18:30 - 19:35 - Prayer

19:56 - 22:17 - Song MP 1076 Jesus be the centre

23:14 - 23:36 - 2nd Reading Luke 13.34 read by Kitty Bird
Jesus said, ‘Jerusalem…How often have I desired to gather your
children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and
you were not willing!’

23:42 - 29:54 - Short talk: ‘Mothering – instinct to protect’
Linking to the reading where Jesus pictures himself as a mother hen.
The instinct of protecting their young is shared among animals, including elephants, lions, cows, and birds.
It's important to respect animals' protective instincts when we come close to them.
Jesus longs to protect the human family and lead them into a better way of security, safety, peace, and dignity.
Imagine ourselves and other people as little chicks or goslings under the wing of Jesus.
Mothering Sunday is not just about celebrating biological mothers but also all kinds of people who care and protect others.
The importance of empathy and understanding in mothering.
The speaker encourages the audience to think about how they can protect and care for others.


30:39 - 33:52 - Song MP 583 Safe in the shadow of the Lord

35:20 - 36:02 - 3rd reading Matthew 12.46-50 NIVUK read by Kitty Bird
46  While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and
brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.  47  Someone told
him, ‘Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to
speak to you.’
48  He replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my
brothers?’  49  Pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother
and my brothers.  50  For whoever does the will of my Father in
heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’

36:09 - 36:44 - 4th Reading: John 19.26-27 read by Jeany Bien
26  When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he
loved standing near by, he said to her, ‘Woman, here is your
son,’  27  and to the disciple, ‘Here is your mother.’ From that time
on, this disciple took her into his home.

36:52 - 45:22 - Short Talk: ‘God’s new family’
Jesus welcomes all who follow him to be part of God's family.
People in church who show care and interest in others make a difference.
The church family can have arguments and divisions, but we are part of an amazing family of God.
Jesus entrusted his mother to John to care for her and play his part in the family of God.
We give thanks for mothers, physical or adoptive, as well as fathers who may play a maternal role.
Men and women can share the role of being a mother to their children.
We give thanks for brothers and sisters in the family of God, as well as children and those who have cared for us.
Mothering Sunday can be an emotional day with many different emotions.

A church in Bierton, North of Aylesbury, linked to a Christian woman from medieval times called Asif.
Rivers, especially chalk streams, are important for wildlife and need to be looked after for the benefit of both wildlife and ourselves.

A new high seas treaty by the United Nations to create large protected areas of the oceans to safeguard marine biodiversity.
Water is a key theme in Lent this year with support for Water Aid, which provides clean water and sanitation to many poor communities around the world.
The effects of climate change on water supplies in many poorer nations and the need to create water and sanitation services that last and can come back quickly online after a climate hazard.
Women's voices and experiences are essential in adapting to climate change, and they must be heard and acted upon.

34:50 - 37:50 - Reading: John 4.16 – 30 NIVUK read by Abigail Lokko

38:19 - 44:11- Short Address
Wells are significant places in the Bible, and many important meetings took place at wells.
Jacob's Well, located in modern-day Palestine, is the most famous well in the Bible.
Maria, who lives in a small island in El Salvador, has to travel to the mainland every day to fetch water because there is no mains water on her island.
Many women in low-income countries have to do this kind of work every day.
In the encounter between Jesus and the Samaritan woman, both were thirsty and had to act to quench their thirst.
The physical and spiritual aspects of our lives are intertwined and essential to our well-being.
The American theologian Sally McFague believed that the interconnection of our souls and bodies brings us life in all its fullness.
We should value both physical and spiritual water as essential to our life and well-being.
We should recognize and accept everyone as brother and sister, as well as being accepted as a child of God.
We should be thirsty for the Water of Life.

followed by 2 or 3 minutes of quiet reflection on these questions:
- Do we welcome and value both the physical water and the
spiritual water as essential to our life and well-being?
- What do they teach us about recognising and accepting
everyone as brother and sister?
- What do we learn for ourselves about being accepted as
brother or sister, and a child of God?
- Are we thirsty for the water of life?

Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

07:55 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

10:13 - Call to worship 
We come to worship you, Lord, the maker of our lives.
We come to meet you, Lord, the keeper of our lives.
We come to hear you, Lord, the wisdom in our lives.
We come to follow you, Lord, the guider of our lives.

11:06 - 13:36 - Hymn - R&amp;S 67  Immortal, invisible, God only wise

13:42 - Prayers of adoration and confession

15:30 - 28:51 - All age talk: ‘Help! I need somebody!’
The Beatles and their song &quot;Help&quot; as an example of asking for help.
What helps you get through the day - things like daily devotions, friends, family, and nature.
The importance of turning to God for help, as well as offering help to others.
The Jars of Change appeal, which involves setting aside money over Lent to donate to the charity.
The charity's focus this year is on providing clean water and sanitation to communities in need.
Stories of two young women who have benefited from the charity's work.
The idea of giving and helping others, even in small ways.
A reminder that help can come from God and from our willingness to offer help to others.

29:18 - 30:16 - Reading: Psalm 121 NIVUK read by Ian Bogart
I lift up my eyes to the mountains –
    where does my help come from?
2 My help comes from the Lord,
    the Maker of heaven and earth.
3 He will not let your foot slip –
    he who watches over you will not slumber;
4 indeed, he who watches over Israel
    will neither slumber nor sleep.
5 The Lord watches over you –
    the Lord is your shade at your right hand;
6 the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
7 The Lord will keep you from all harm –
    he will watch over your life;
8 the Lord will watch over your coming and going
    both now and for evermore.

31:00 - 33:37 - Hymn - R&amp;S 64  I lift my eyes to the quiet hills

33:44 - Introduction to the reading

34:47 - 37:13 - Reading: John 3.1-17 NIVUK 

37:34 - 39:39 - Hymn - MP 619  Such love
 
39:43 - 53:26 - Short Address:
The Repair Shop and the team of experts who restore old and broken items.
In August 2021, the team met with Prince Charles and learned about his foundation's work in training young craftspeople.
Charles gave the team a piece of pottery made for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and an 18th-century clock to repair.
Jay Blades, one of the show's hosts, grew up in Hackney, and he and Charles bonded over their shared interests in apprenticeships and heritage crafts.
The encounter between Nicodemus and Jesus in the Bible is similar to the meeting of Blades and Charles in that it brings together people from different backgrounds who share common interests.
Nicodemus is a Pharisee and a member of the ruling council in Jerusalem who comes to meet Jesus at night.
Nicodemus recognizes that God is at work in Jesus's ministry and life.
Jesus tells Nicodemus that he must be born again to see the kingdom of God.
This spiritual rebirth is about a fundamental change that enables us to see the kingdom of love, justice, and peace where God is at the center.
Jesus teaches that his followers must become like little children to enter the kingdom of heaven.
The kingdom of heaven is a place where God is at the center and all are of equal worth in the eyes of God.

53:30 - 58:22 - Prayers for the world with the response
So, God of compassion: 
open our hearts, to welcome all.

58:23 - Prayer of Dedication of all our gifts

A Prayer of thanksgiving and Lord’s Prayer

Distribution of bread and wine (non-alcoholic grape juice)

22:35 - 24:18 - Readings:  Psalm 32 NIVUK 
 
24:40 - 26:11 - Matthew 4:1-11 

27:29 - 29:42 - Hymn R&amp;S 543– Lead us heavenly Father Lead Us

29:48 - 41:05 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
Drawing inspiration from the hymn &quot;Father Lead Me Day by Day&quot; and Jesus' identity affirmation from God during his baptism.
The assurance of being saved by grace is necessary in our lives.
The promises of God should be hidden in our hearts to remain steadfast during temptations.
The full armor of God should be worn to stand firm against the devil's schemes.
Jesus defeated Satan on the cross, and we must use his name to resist temptations.
Jesus' response to temptations was quoting the word of God.
The spirit drives us into unusual and unexplored places.
The spirit is at work whenever people speak the language of love, dream of a new community, and reach out to one another.
God is gracious and picks us up when we stumble and fall into ditches along the way.
Nothing in all creation can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, and goodness is stronger than evil, love is stronger than hate.
As children of God, we need to have the promises of God hidden in our hearts and be sure of our identity in Him. 
Temptations will come, but we can stand firm by putting on the full armor of God and using the Word of God to resist the devil's schemes. 
The Spirit may also drive us into unusual and unexplored places, and we need to be open to following His leading. Ultimately, we can take comfort in the fact that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, and victory is ours through Him who loves us.

10:28 - Call to worship
Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his holy mountain, for
the Lord our God is holy. Grace and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ

10:56 - 14:37 - Hymn - MP 77 Christ triumphant

14:40 - Opening Prayer of praise with the response
God of glory (truth), to you
We offer our worship and praise.

17:35 - Lord’s Prayer (modern version)

18:18 - Introduction: ‘what just happened?’
The importance of paying attention and being good witnesses in our daily lives. 
A scene from Sherlock Holmes to illustrate how we often do things without noticing.


25:43 - 27:09 - Readings: Exodus 24.12-18 NIVUK 

27:23 - 36:34 - Short Talk: ‘A mountain top experience’
The story of Moses and the giving of the Ten Commandments is a significant moment in the faith story.
The invitation from God for Moses to come up the mountain was initially frightening but is seen as gracious.
Mountains have been sacred places in many different cultures and faiths, and they speak of powers beyond our own.
The Holy God is described as a mystery, appearing as cloud, blazing light, and fire.
The law that Moses was given on the mountain would make the Israelites a holy people as they live by the Commandments of honoring God and loving their neighbor.
Moses stayed on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights, which is significant in both the Old and New Testaments.
Lent is a period of 40 days, leading up to the eve of Easter, and represents a journey towards the Mountaintop of Easter day.
The signs of spring, such as snowdrops, are a symbol of God's renewing love and a reminder of the presence of Jesus.
The prayer at the end of the passage is a reminder to seek hope and peace during the darker days and to be enlightened on our journey through Lent and beyond.

36:44 - 40:03 - Hymn - 454 Majesty, worship his majesty

40:32 - 41:57 - Reading: Matthew 17. 1 – 9 (The Message) 

42:36 - 44:22 - Hymn - MP 545 Open our eyes Lord (sung twice seated)

45:20 - 47:13 - Reflection: ‘After the event’ Peter, James and John remember
&quot;Brothers of thunder&quot;

48:18 - 51:19 - Hymn - MP 1227 The splendour of the King

51:22 - 01:00:35 - Short talk: ‘wonderers, worshippers and witnesses’
The topic of reflection is the story of the three disciples who went up the mountain with Jesus and witnessed the splendor of God.
A reflection on four words related to the story of Jesus and his disciples on the mountain: wonder, worship, witness, and work.
Wonder: Take a step back and wonder at the mysteries of God's presence, creation, and scripture during the season of Lent.
Worship: The disciples' worship involved listening to Jesus, listen deeply to Jesus in scripture as the heart of worship.
Witness: Witness to the reality of Jesus with humility and through both words and actions.
Work: The disciples were invited to be part of the work of Jesus, we should pray for and participate in God's work in the world today.

The disciples' experience on the mountain was a revelation of divine light that they could not put into words.
The disciples' response was to worship, but they had a lot to learn about true worship, which involves following and listening to Jesus.
Listening to Jesus is at the heart of worship and is an essential aspect of our tradition.
After wandering, worshiping, and listening, we are called to be witnesses of Jesus, but our witness can be mistaken if we fail to witness to the reality of Jesus.
Witnessing requires humility and a deep understanding of the love of God.
We are encouraged to pray for God's work in the world and for our part in it.


Prayer Activity ending with shared prayer

All our prayers, silent and spoken we bring to you, God of life
and light. Help us to know the love of Jesus, to see his hidden
glory, shining all around. Amen.

01:00:47 - 01:04:24 - Hymn - MP 728 We have a gospel to proclaim
