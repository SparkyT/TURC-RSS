Call to worship
HYMN R&amp;amp;S 117 O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
Opening Prayers and Lord’s Prayer
Introduction for all ages
SONG MP 225 He’s got the whole wide world in His hands
Introducing the readings
Reading: Jeremiah 23. 23 – 29 NIVUK read by Richard Harding
‘Am I only a God nearby,’ declares the LORD,
‘and not a God far away?
24  Who can hide in secret places
so that I cannot see them?’ declares the LORD.
 ‘Do not I fill heaven and earth?’ declares the LORD.
25  ‘I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my
name. They say, “I had a dream! I had a dream!”  26  How long will
this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy
the delusions of their own minds?  27  They think the dreams they
tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their
ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship.  28  Let the prophet
who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my

word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?’
declares the LORD.  29  ‘Is not my word like fire,’ declares the LORD,
‘and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?
Reading: Luke 12. 49 – 56 read by Larry Ogbewe
49  ‘I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were
already kindled!  50  But I have a baptism to undergo, and what
constraint I am under until it is completed!  51  Do you think I came
to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.  52  From now on
there will be five in one family divided against each other, three
against two and two against three.  53  They will be divided, father
against son and son against father, mother against daughter and
daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law
and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.’
54  He said to the crowd: ‘When you see a cloud rising in the west,
immediately you say, “It’s going to rain,” and it does.  55  And when
the south wind blows, you say, “It’s going to be hot,” and it
is.  56  Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the
earth and the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret
this present time?
HYMN R&amp;amp;S 317 Lord thy word, abideth
Address
Silent reflection
Offering Prayer for all our giving
HYMN R&amp;amp;S 567 Thy hand, O God, has guided
Prayers for others and ourselves
HYMN R&amp;amp;S 373 Lord Jesus Christ, you have come to us

Blessing</media:description>

09:24 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (by an elder)

11:01 - Call to worship (based on Hebrews 10)
Let us come near to God with open hearts,
for Jesus has opened for us a new and living way.
Let us hold on firmly to the hope we profess,
because we can trust God to keep his promise. 
Let us be concerned for one another,
helping one another to show love and do good.
Let us come together and encourage each other,
more and more, as we follow Jesus here and now.


12:30 - Hymn - R&amp;S 102 Praise the Lord, his glories show

15:42 - Opening Prayers with responses
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.
Christ have mercy: Christ have mercy.
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.

19:08 - 27:30 - Introduction: a word from Lighthouse
What is Lighthouse?
When is it?
Where is it held?
Who is involved?
What do we do?
How can you help?

28:00 - Lighthouse Song (video)

32:43 - 34:18 - Reading: Psalm 98 NIVUK 

Sing to the LORD a new song,
    for he has done marvelous things;
his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
2  The LORD has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
3  He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel;
all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
4  Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music;
5  make music to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing,
6  with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn – shout for joy before the LORD, the King.
7  Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.
8  Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy;
9  let them sing before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.
He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.

36:31 - 38:24 - Reading: Hebrews 1. 1 – 8 NIVUK 
1 In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many
times and in various ways,  2  but in these last days he has spoken to us by
his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also
he made the universe.  3  The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the
exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful
word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the
right hand of the Majesty in heaven.  4  So he became as much superior to
the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
5  For to which of the angels did God ever say,
‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father’?
Or again, ‘I will be his Father,  and he will be my Son’?
6  And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says,
‘Let all God’s angels worship him.’
7  In speaking of the angels he says,

38:50 - 47:00 - Introducing the letter to the Hebrews (video)
47:04 - 47:57 - Summary of the reading and letter to the Hebrews

47:59 - Song: R&amp;S 271 You are the king of glory

50:42 - Prayer

51:10 - 52:07 - Reading Hebrews 4.14 – 16 NIVUK
14  Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into
heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we
profess.  15  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to feel
sympathy for our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted
in every way, just as we are – yet he did not sin.  16  Let us then approach
God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy
and find grace to help us in our time of need.

52:10 - 01:00:39 - Talk: ‘Hold on!’
&quot;Grace to help us in our time of need&quot;
As we look at the world right now, we see a time of great need
The Ukraine, China, Taiwan, The Other Western Nations, The Climate Emergency, Environmental Need, Displacement due to conflict, the refugee crisis, doubt in the democratic process as our government attempts to regain trust and integrity, the cost of living crisis: surely this is a time of need
But centuries ago these Jewish Christians, different to us in language, understandings, lifestyles. Think of their lives burdened by absolute poverty, unsure what persecution would arise in the brutal Roman Empire.  They were in a time of need.
Some questioned whether their faith was enough, some were slipping away
The writer challenges them to hold on to the precious gift of Jesus given to them
He was tempted but held on to his god even when all had deserted him
Draw close the writer says, don't turn back, hold fast and come with confidence to your saviour
Let the radiance of God's glory shine bright in your dark place and in the dark places of our world 

01:00:50 - Offering Prayer (of all our gifts – no collection is taken up)

01:01:41 - Song R&amp;S 375 In my life, Lord, be glorified

01:03:41 - Prayers for the church and the world with the response:
Great God, in your mercy
hear our prayer.

01:09:19 - Lord’s Prayer

01:10:08 - Hymn R&amp;S 598 Will your anchor hold?

01:15:10 - 01:15:35 - Blessing

08:57 - Call to worship (from Hebrews 13)

God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’  
So we say with confidence,
‘The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. 
What can mere mortals do to me?
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.
Therefore, through Jesus, let us continually offer to God 
a sacrifice of praise and not forget to do good 
and to share with others.

09:48 - Hymn: R&amp;S 377  This is the day!

12:32 - Opening Prayers with the response
It is good to give thanks to you, our God:
 your love endures for ever.

15:10 - 24:12 - Introduction: ‘Time!’
We make it or waste it
Where has the year gone?
Coming in 2 minutes early
Time to stay for refreshments afterwards
Watching the clock too much?
Images from the James Webb telescope, seeing images from things that happened thousands of years ago in the Southern Ring Nebula
8 minute for light from the sun to reach us
Do you have time?
Special thanks in this jubilee year for the URC, 50 years since the formation?
Lighthouse starting in 1987
Our sanctuary refurbished in 2009

24:52 - 26:41 - Reading: Psalm 145. 1 – 13 

26:54 - Song: Thank you Lord for this fine day! (Junior Praise 232)

30:45 - 35:55 - Introducing activity : 50 years of the United Reformed Church
I hope 1972 is in your minds at the moment
The union of Presbyterian and Congregationalist Christians that started the URC
Congregational Union of Scotland joining in 2000 
Activity: ‘50 year Time line’ 1972 – 2022 and beyond
Think about 3 events to put on the timeline: a personal one, a special moment in the church, and an event in the community, nation or world

41:30 - Worship song: MP 1259  Bless the Lord o my soul

45:44 - Introduction to reading

46:16 - 47:35 - Reading: Luke 4.14 – 21 (The Message) 

47:47 - 52:42 - All age talk: ‘The Time is now!’
What a moment that must have been - that synagogue where Jesus read the words from Isaiah saying what he was about
For the United Reformed Church, this is seen as a jubilee year, when we want God's time to shine
Anniversary socks from the URC Ministers' gathering
What else can you buy that's URC branded - soap!
Jesus gives his agenda in the moment in Galilee - a very particular place and moment
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me - to bring good news to the poor
God's time is now
Good news can't just be words, it has to be actions
The story ends with Jesus being turned out and a crowd attempting to stone him
Moments of jubilation and despair on our timeline
Is God shining through Jesus and hist followers
We need to open our eyes to find where that light is shining in unexpected places


54:58 - Song: MP 545  Open my eyes Lord

55:55 - Short talk: Vision for Trinity 
Key themes from the planning group - worship and Christian discipleship
Outward looking, communicating the good news of Jesus
Focusing on the resources we have - buildings, finance and people
Working in partnership
Start small - crawl, walk, then run
Doing something, not remaining paralysed

Offering Prayer (of all our gifts – no collection is taken up)

59:08 - 01:00:11 - Song Open my hands Lord
Open our hands, Lord,
we want to serve Jesus,
to reach out in his name,
and show his love for all.
Open our hearts, Lord,
and help us to follow.
Open our hands, Lord,
we want to serve Jesus.

01:00:16 - Prayers for the church and the world with the response
Your kingdom come
  Your will be done.
Lord’s Prayer (modern version)

01:06:48 - Hymn R&amp;S 489  Be thou my vision

19:09 - Hymn When morning gilds the sky (R&amp;S 292)

22:40 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

25:15 - 34:07 - Talk for all ages: “Teach us to pray”
We are glad it's not as hot as last Monday and Tuesday
When it's that hot, it's hard to even think, one just wants to be still and get through it
Think about a time when you had to learn a skill
Sometimes the learning is successful, sometimes not
Learning to tie shoelaces?
Learning to play the piano?
Learning to drive?
In the reading from Luke's gospel, the disciples want Jesus to teach them how to pray.
In Luke more than others, we hear of when Jesus is praying
We have already used the prayer he taught them all two thousand years ago
There is so much in the Lord's Prayer
What he taught them was not what they were expecting which was something long and wordy
What Jesus taught was a simple prayer, the short version of this can be said just in one breath
If ever you are uncertain of how to pray, the Lord's Prayer is a great place to start

34:22 - Hymn - Father I place into your hands (R&amp;S 518)

34:50 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:
Adults: May the Lord be with you
Junior Church: And also with you
All: Amen.

37:53 - Introduction to Bible readings

38:23 - Reading: Luke 11. 1 – 13 NIVUK
11 One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one
of his disciples said to him, ‘Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his
disciples.’
2  He said to them, ‘When you pray, say:
‘“Father,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come.
3  Give us each day our daily bread.
4  Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.
And lead us not into temptation.”’
5  Then Jesus said to them, ‘Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him
at midnight and say, “Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;  6  a friend of
mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer
him.”  7  And suppose the one inside answers, “Don’t bother me. The door
is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and
give you anything.”  8  I tell you, even though he will not get up and give
you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless
audacity ]  he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.
9  ‘So I say to you: ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find;
knock and the door will be opened to you.  10  For everyone who asks
receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door
will be opened.
11  ‘Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake
instead?  12  Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?  13  If you then,
though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who
ask him!’

40:35 - 42:43 - Reading: Colossians 2. 6 – 15 NIVUK 


43:03 - Hymn - I will sing the wondrous story (CMP 315)

46:52 - Prayer
47:46 - 01:05:06 - Sermon: “Ask and you will receive”
These familiar words are used just after the Disciples ask Jesus to teach them how to pray 
They highlight how important it is for us to ask, seek, knock and pray
Why do some people say prayer is irrelevant
Looking at prayer in the context of our relationship with God
Finally thinking about the nature of God that sets the words in context
Distinguishing between gifts from God as creator and father - creation and redemption

A time of quiet reflection

01:06:00 - Hymn - What a friend we have in Jesus (R&amp;S 413)

15:59 - Opening Prayers 
Lord’s Prayer 

18:54 - 23:40 - Talk with all ages - Prophets
Our first reading will be from one of the Old Testament Prophets
Do any of our young people understand what prophets
One that prophesies, something where you spend money to make more money
Homophones and prophets/profits
We all profit from the wisdom of the prophets
Prophets weren't actually telling the future, their job was to tell it like it is
Speaking truth to power and telling those in power that things were not going as they should be
Thinking of modern day prophets
Greta Thunberg - a schoolgirl but understands the world as it is today is not going to be able to sustain itself unless we change.

23:55 - Song TP 13  Be still, for the presence of the Lord   

27:05 - Offering Prayer (of all our gifts – no collection is taken up)

Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:
Adults:   The Lord be with you
Junior Church:  And also with you
All:      Amen.

29:10 - Introduction to the readings
  
30:21 - Reading: Amos 7:7-17 NIVUK 


33:32 - 35:35 - Reading: Colossians 1: 1 – 14 NIVUK 

35:45 - Song: TP 13   God forgave my sin

38:31 - 50:48 - Address: How to live a good life which honors God
The two bible readings could hardly be more different
Separated in time by about 800 years, the tone of the two is markedly different
Amos wrote his prophecy in around 760BC some 20 years before the better known Isiah
Amos didn't see himself as a prophet, not employed by anyone important, he worked the land.
He traveled widely and knew the northern kingdom well.
He saw lots of inequality and divisions in society
Merchants were paying lip service only to their religion
The Altar at Bethel was being used to worship false Gods
When he challenged the High Priest, Amos was told to go back to Judah
Amos warned that Israel's exile to Assyria was at had but was ignored
There are sad parallels with our society today
Our Prime Minister Boris Johnson wriggling out of one scandal after another. Now irretrievably rejected by his MPs he has accepted he needs to go but is still clinging to power. Brought down by his own dishonest.
Think of Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the war crimes committed there.
Think of the riots in Sri Lanka
Think of the earthquake in Afghanistan and all of the other issues there
Paul's letter to the Colossians is in contrast to this.
Written from house arrest in Rome whilst waiting for false accusations to be dealt with.
It is full of hope, written to stem the influence of teaching aimed at trapping the people in superstition
We are still Paul's congregation
We have been rescued by God through Christ Jesus, forgiving our sins.
Paul's message helps us to bear in mind that God in Christ Jesus is all in all, first and last, head of the Church, all powerful and generous in return for our faith and obedience to God's law - loving him with all our strength, soul, and mind and to love our neighbour as we love ourself

12:17 - Call to worship 

12:42 - Hymn - Jesus calls us here

15:45 - 22:03 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer
Nice to be back after COVID, seeing everyone getting back into more normal activities

36:51 - 56:18 - Talk  followed by time of quiet reflection 
The story of the paralysed man was the first that came to mind to speak about
The &quot;para&quot; part has become common in conversation in our family in the past 18 months since our daughter Nina was diagnosed with MS and subsequently gained a place in the GB para-snowboard squad.
Nina is the opposite to the paralysed man in the story.  He had been sitting by the pool for 38 years.  We don't know how he got there every day.  He told himself when the pool stirred, one of these days he would be first in and would be able to walk.
After 38 years, did he feel it was too much to hope to walk in the way others did?  Why had no-one helped him in those 38 years
Elijah traveled as he was told to and met a widow. He wanted a drink and something to eat.  There was only enough flour and oil to make bread for her and her son but she shared it with him and there was more
In the third story, the man had good friends who were determined he should have a chance to be healed lowering him through a roof to get him in front of Jesus
Finding friends who help for no benefit to themselves
Feeling part of a new group and belonging
Remembering who you are and where you come from
Making a difference to people, one individual at a time
Finding someone we can each help

57:05 - Hymn - O let the Son of God enfold you 

01:00:30 - Prayers for others and ourselves

One of those mornings, I couldn't find my flag to wave
We come this amazing weekend for our nation to remember the work of our Queen over those 70 years
What a life of service
How many of you have seen the Queen in person
Over 1/3 of the population feel they have had a connection with Her Majesty
Paddington and James Bond, Bond with his courage and brokenness, Paddington an immigrant from Darkest Peru
Junior Church prayer tree now featuring a squirrel, a blue tit and a caterpillar
The Church Of England is obliged to pray for the Queen
The corronation speech from Her Majesty - &quot;Throughout this memorable day I have been uplifted and sustained by the knowledge that your thoughts and prayers were with me&quot; - https://www.royal.uk/coronation-day-speech-2-june-1953
The church sustaining us
Let's hold each other in prayer day by day, week by week

21:20 - Jubilee Song - Rise Up and Serve
Rise Up and Serve song (video to watch) with the chorus:
‘Rise up and serve’ is the call we hear
With hope in our hearts, joining as one, making history.
Let fanfares sound through this Jubilee
Rise up and serve, thanking God for Her Majesty.

27:55 - National Anthem
God save our gracious Queen
Long live our noble Queen
God save the Queen
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen

Not in this land alone,
But be God's mercies known,
From shore to shore!
Lord make the nations see,
That all should kindred be,
And form one family,
The wide world o'er.

I hope you have been enjoying this 4 day weekend
Escaping the pettiness of politics, #partygate mentioned in the comedy links at the party
A bit of fun, pomp and ceremony, and some history
Celebrating this stateswoman in our midst
Her contribution to this nation was recognised and thanks given for it
Was the Queen watching from home as so many of us have done over the past 2 years
Impressed by the involvement of young people across the Commonwealth
Soggy street parties as the culmination of a great weekend?
Today is also Pentecost
In Jewish tradition a time to celebrate the giving of the Torah
Moving from the incredible events of the cross and resurrection of Jesus, sending out the disciples with all their joy to tell people the good news
As small group of disciples and a large crows from all known nations
We need individuals that inspire us - The Queen, David Attenborough , Michelle #Obama
Peter stood up when the disciples were being mocked for being drunk to turn hearts and bring thousands to God
More than that we need communities that are transformed by the joy and peace of the coming of the spirit
The Pentecost story is about being filled with the Holy Spirit, not just being given it, telling people how all could be saved
We need individuals but we need the Spirit of God to inspire his followers today
The Spirit is God's gift to us all

49:06 - 52:36 Prayers for the church and the world with the response
Come Holy Spirit, give new strength and hope.

52:52 - Hymn - MP 673 There is a Redeemer

55:33 - Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at
church (or at home) united in the name of Christ, empowered by
the Spirit.
A Prayer of thanksgiving and Lord’s Prayer

58:54 - Distribution of Communion and Closing Prayer

01:04:52 - Hymn We sing a love that sets all people free TUNE R&amp;S 740
We sing a love that sets all people free,
that blows like wind, that burns like scorching flame,
enfolds the earth, springs up like water clear:
come, living love, live in our hearts today.

We sing a love that seeks another’s good,
that longs to serve and not to count the cost,
a love that, yielding, finds itself made new:
come, caring love, live in our hearts today.

We sing the Holy Spirit, full of love,
who seeks out scars of ancient bitterness,
brings to our wounds the healing grace of Christ:
come, radiant love, live in our hearts today.

23:38 - Opening Prayers
25:18 - Lord’s Prayer

25:57 - 34:39 - Introduction: ‘Love Wycombe?’ 
I hope you have all heard of Love Wycombe by now
Part of the life of churches in Wycombe for over a decade now
This year by the Guildhall on 12th June
As we pray for the Wycombe area, work for its good and prepare to celebrate God’s love for all, let’s ask two questions:
    What do you three things like about your community?
   What three improvements would you like to see happen?


34:46 - 34:38 -  Reading: Psalm 122 read by Kate Yates

42:53 - Song R&amp;S 264 He is Lord (sung seated as a prayer)

45:42 - 57:45 - Talk:  ‘Mountain top and city streets’
This Sunday is fascinating - is it Easter or something else
It's called different things depending on which lectionary you use
Jesus has died and risen but the holy spirit has not yet arrived. 10 days of waiting.
Is Jesus still with them or has he gone?
Luke describes the ascension in the most literal terms of the 4 gospels
Jesus ascending to heaven wasn't an Apollo/Elon Musk trip to space
There was a transition as Jesus left the physical space and became the greater reality no longer restricted by flesh and blood, opening the disciples' minds
Opening minds - the most important thing for us as Christians today?
Getting caught up in all of our transitions, turning back again and again to the living Jesus who opens our minds to understand the scriptures anew


57:48 - Hymn R&amp;S 579 Lord thy church on earth

01:01:28 - ‘Thy Kingdom come’: Global Wave of Prayer
 LOVE THE WORLD 
God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life…God sent him not to condemn the world …but to save the world.
John 3.16, 17

Prayers for the church and the world with the response:
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done.

 LOVE WYCOMBE TODAY 
Today as we pick up litter in the neighbourhood.
Today as we pray for our neighbours (street by street in ‘Prayer walking’).
Today as we pray for the central event planned for Sunday 12 June

01:10:09 - Hymn -  R&amp;S 603  Lord for the years

01:13:54 -1:14:24 - Blessing.

Called to help a man whilst in Troas leading to a journey that ended up in Phillipi
No real maps, not a carefree journey.  They had been warned off certain places
Taking risks as missionaries
For people of faith, it's God who sets direction and walks with us
Macedonia then and now
God's spirit moves us when God desires
God hears all and is omnipresent
Should we set off and see what happens to us as part of God's plan

52:37 - Hymn: R&amp;S 59 God moves in mysterious ways

20:12 - Lord’s Prayer

21:12 - Reading - Psalm 1 (Good News version)

22:08 - 25:55 - Short talk: ‘Well-watered trees’
If only life were as simple as the psalm suggests
We know there are great contrasts between good and evil
We are a bit of a mixture, sometimes selfish, sometimes calm and compassionate
Psalms often paint things in stark contrast and we have to be careful not to be too arrogant
We have to try to be the well watered trees with long roots pulling up the nutrients
Think of a tree you are familiar with - near here, in your garden, in a nearby park
What if it is suddenly cut down? How would you feel?
We want to be a well watered tree - for us the water is the spirit of God.
Enabling us to fruit with the gifts of the spirit - love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self control.

46:02 - 55:20 - Short Talk – God’s renewing of our world
What do you think of that reading?
A fantastic book by John with amazing poetry and fantastic visual
For the Israelites, the sea was something filled with disorder and chaos
In John's imagination we see a river bringing life and causing deserts to bloom
Thinking of Janet with her seed and barrel of water to bring life 
Walking the Thames path
Still a polluted river but a lot less than in the previous centrury
Think of a pure river, wherever it goes, trees grow.
In this vision, the tree grew on both sides of the bank
The tree of life is everywhere the river goes
Beating swords into plowshares
A vision of new life
Miracles - the UK coming second in Eurovision
Praying Ukraine can get to peace and host the next contest
Love Wycombe

13:15 - Hymn R&amp;S 47 O worship the King

17:25 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

20:23 - Reading: John 10. 22 – 30 NIVUK 

21:40 - 24:50 - Talk for all ages
Having to read a lot of CQC reports about various care homes
You can see where people have done things better or worse than you
Under the heading of care it often states that the residents are appropriately dressed - strange at first sight but actually is a good indication of care.
Pulled up one time for a resident wearing a combination of garish clothes
Humans are good at making their own minds up and working things out.
People going to Jesus and asking whether he was the Messiah
Jesus showing people in lots of ways how he loved them and cared for them
Perhaps we need to look for Jesus in all things and follow the signs.

25:00 - Hymn MP 1008 The Lord’s my shepherd (Townsend version)

28:27 - 30:21 - Reading: Acts 9. 36 - 43 NIVUK 

30:24 - Hymn R&amp;S 277 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

33:33 - 49:40 - Address
The reputation of sheep for not being the brightest in the world
Christians getting annoyed when compared to sheep
Sheep seeking security of the flock and following the shepherd
Knowing their shepherd
Needing a leader, someone to guide them
We are like that, needing Jesus
Jesus provides the security of an eternal kingdom
Christianity is not about Christians behaving themselves, it's about hope for those who have none
That's us - filled with doubt and fear, having to cut through uncertainty and ambiguity to belief
Terry Kelly - songwriter from Nova Scotia - In my Father's House
When we are with God, he provides the sanctuary from life's storms, all we have to do is come inside with faith

50:09 - Hymn R&amp;S 552 The King of love my shepherd is

53:34 - Prayers of intercession
