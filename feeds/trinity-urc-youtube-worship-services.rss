10:31 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

12:17 - Call to worship 

12:42 - Hymn - Jesus calls us here

15:45 - 22:03 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer
Nice to be back after COVID, seeing everyone getting back into more normal activities

22:05 - Song -  Be still for the presence of the Lord

28:41 - 30:50 - Reading: John 5 vv 1-15 
 
30:56 - 32:28 - Reading Luke 5  vv17-36

32:35 - Hymn - Christ’s is the world in which we live 

36:51 - 56:18 - Talk  followed by time of quiet reflection 
The story of the paralysed man was the first that came to mind to speak about
The &quot;para&quot; part has become common in conversation in our family in the past 18 months since our daughter Nina was diagnosed with MS and subsequently gained a place in the GB para-snowboard squad.
Nina is the opposite to the paralysed man in the story.  He had been sitting by the pool for 38 years.  We don't know how he got there every day.  He told himself when the pool stirred, one of these days he would be first in and would be able to walk.
After 38 years, did he feel it was too much to hope to walk in the way others did?  Why had no-one helped him in those 38 years
Elijah traveled as he was told to and met a widow. He wanted a drink and something to eat.  There was only enough flour and oil to make bread for her and her son but she shared it with him and there was more
In the third story, the man had good friends who were determined he should have a chance to be healed lowering him through a roof to get him in front of Jesus
Finding friends who help for no benefit to themselves
Feeling part of a new group and belonging
Remembering who you are and where you come from
Making a difference to people, one individual at a time
Finding someone we can each help

57:05 - Hymn - O let the Son of God enfold you 

01:00:30 - Prayers for others and ourselves

01:05:33 - Offering Prayer of Dedication

12:15 - Opening Prayers

14:55 - 21:19 -  Introduction: the Queen’s Jubilee – ‘held in prayer’
One of those mornings, I couldn't find my flag to wave
We come this amazing weekend for our nation to remember the work of our Queen over those 70 years
What a life of service
How many of you have seen the Queen in person
Over 1/3 of the population feel they have had a connection with Her Majesty
Paddington and James Bond, Bond with his courage and brokenness, Paddington an immigrant from Darkest Peru
Junior Church prayer tree now featuring a squirrel, a blue tit and a caterpillar
The Church Of England is obliged to pray for the Queen
The corronation speech from Her Majesty - &quot;Throughout this memorable day I have been uplifted and sustained by the knowledge that your thoughts and prayers were with me&quot; - https://www.royal.uk/coronation-day-speech-2-june-1953
The church sustaining us
Let's hold each other in prayer day by day, week by week

21:20 - Jubilee Song - Rise Up and Serve
Rise Up and Serve song (video to watch) with the chorus:
‘Rise up and serve’ is the call we hear
With hope in our hearts, joining as one, making history.
Let fanfares sound through this Jubilee
Rise up and serve, thanking God for Her Majesty.

27:55 - National Anthem
God save our gracious Queen
Long live our noble Queen
God save the Queen
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen

Not in this land alone,
But be God's mercies known,
From shore to shore!
Lord make the nations see,
That all should kindred be,
And form one family,
The wide world o'er.

29:27 - Prayer for Her Majesty

38:31 - 49:05 - Short Talk
I hope you have been enjoying this 4 day weekend
Escaping the pettiness of politics, #partygate mentioned in the comedy links at the party
A bit of fun, pomp and ceremony, and some history
Celebrating this stateswoman in our midst
Her contribution to this nation was recognised and thanks given for it
Was the Queen watching from home as so many of us have done over the past 2 years
Impressed by the involvement of young people across the Commonwealth
Soggy street parties as the culmination of a great weekend?
Today is also Pentecost
In Jewish tradition a time to celebrate the giving of the Torah
Moving from the incredible events of the cross and resurrection of Jesus, sending out the disciples with all their joy to tell people the good news
As small group of disciples and a large crows from all known nations
We need individuals that inspire us - The Queen, David Attenborough , Michelle #Obama
Peter stood up when the disciples were being mocked for being drunk to turn hearts and bring thousands to God
More than that we need communities that are transformed by the joy and peace of the coming of the spirit
The Pentecost story is about being filled with the Holy Spirit, not just being given it, telling people how all could be saved
We need individuals but we need the Spirit of God to inspire his followers today
The Spirit is God's gift to us all

49:06 - 52:36 Prayers for the church and the world with the response
Come Holy Spirit, give new strength and hope.

52:52 - Hymn - MP 673 There is a Redeemer

55:33 - Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at
church (or at home) united in the name of Christ, empowered by
the Spirit.
A Prayer of thanksgiving and Lord’s Prayer

58:54 - Distribution of Communion and Closing Prayer

01:04:52 - Hymn We sing a love that sets all people free TUNE R&amp;S 740
We sing a love that sets all people free,
that blows like wind, that burns like scorching flame,
enfolds the earth, springs up like water clear:
come, living love, live in our hearts today.

We sing a love that seeks another’s good,
that longs to serve and not to count the cost,
a love that, yielding, finds itself made new:
come, caring love, live in our hearts today.

We sing the Holy Spirit, full of love,
who seeks out scars of ancient bitterness,
brings to our wounds the healing grace of Christ:
come, radiant love, live in our hearts today.

19:27 - Hymn R&amp;S 262  Crown him with many crowns

23:38 - Opening Prayers
25:18 - Lord’s Prayer

25:57 - 34:39 - Introduction: ‘Love Wycombe?’ 
I hope you have all heard of Love Wycombe by now
Part of the life of churches in Wycombe for over a decade now
This year by the Guildhall on 12th June
As we pray for the Wycombe area, work for its good and prepare to celebrate God’s love for all, let’s ask two questions:
    What do you three things like about your community?
   What three improvements would you like to see happen?


34:46 - 34:38 -  Reading: Psalm 122 read by Kate Yates
36:16 - Peace be with you

36:18 - Song MP 1079  Jesus hope of the nations

40:55  - Introduction to reading

41:09 - 42:22 - Reading: Luke 24. 44 – 53 read by Kate Yates

42:53 - Song R&amp;S 264 He is Lord (sung seated as a prayer)

45:42 - 57:45 - Talk:  ‘Mountain top and city streets’
This Sunday is fascinating - is it Easter or something else
It's called different things depending on which lectionary you use
Jesus has died and risen but the holy spirit has not yet arrived. 10 days of waiting.
Is Jesus still with them or has he gone?
Luke describes the ascension in the most literal terms of the 4 gospels
Jesus ascending to heaven wasn't an Apollo/Elon Musk trip to space
There was a transition as Jesus left the physical space and became the greater reality no longer restricted by flesh and blood, opening the disciples' minds
Opening minds - the most important thing for us as Christians today?
Getting caught up in all of our transitions, turning back again and again to the living Jesus who opens our minds to understand the scriptures anew


57:48 - Hymn R&amp;S 579 Lord thy church on earth

01:01:28 - ‘Thy Kingdom come’: Global Wave of Prayer
 LOVE THE WORLD 
God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life…God sent him not to condemn the world …but to save the world.
John 3.16, 17

Prayers for the church and the world with the response:
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done.

 LOVE WYCOMBE TODAY 
Today as we pick up litter in the neighbourhood.
Today as we pray for our neighbours (street by street in ‘Prayer walking’).
Today as we pray for the central event planned for Sunday 12 June

01:10:09 - Hymn -  R&amp;S 603  Lord for the years

01:13:54 -1:14:24 - Blessing.

No real maps, not a carefree journey.  They had been warned off certain places
Taking risks as missionaries
For people of faith, it's God who sets direction and walks with us
Macedonia then and now
God's spirit moves us when God desires
God hears all and is omnipresent
Should we set off and see what happens to us as part of God's plan

52:37 - Hymn: R&amp;S 59 God moves in mysterious ways

56:52 - Prayers for ourselves and others

13:45 - Hymn R&amp;S 195  I danced in the morning

18:04 - Opening Prayer
20:12 - Lord’s Prayer

21:12 - Reading - Psalm 1 (Good News version)

22:08 - 25:55 - Short talk: ‘Well-watered trees’
If only life were as simple as the psalm suggests
We know there are great contrasts between good and evil
We are a bit of a mixture, sometimes selfish, sometimes calm and compassionate
Psalms often paint things in stark contrast and we have to be careful not to be too arrogant
We have to try to be the well watered trees with long roots pulling up the nutrients
Think of a tree you are familiar with - near here, in your garden, in a nearby park
What if it is suddenly cut down? How would you feel?
We want to be a well watered tree - for us the water is the spirit of God.
Enabling us to fruit with the gifts of the spirit - love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self control.

26:05 - Song Thuma mina (song from South Africa) unaccompanied
1. Thuma mina (x4)

43:21 - Reading: Revelation 21.1-6, 22.1-3 NIVUK

46:02 - 55:20 - Short Talk – God’s renewing of our world
What do you think of that reading?
A fantastic book by John with amazing poetry and fantastic visual
For the Israelites, the sea was something filled with disorder and chaos
In John's imagination we see a river bringing life and causing deserts to bloom
Thinking of Janet with her seed and barrel of water to bring life 
Walking the Thames path
Still a polluted river but a lot less than in the previous centrury
Think of a pure river, wherever it goes, trees grow.
In this vision, the tree grew on both sides of the bank
The tree of life is everywhere the river goes
Beating swords into plowshares
A vision of new life
Miracles - the UK coming second in Eurovision
Praying Ukraine can get to peace and host the next contest

17:25 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

20:23 - Reading: John 10. 22 – 30 NIVUK 

21:40 - 24:50 - Talk for all ages
Having to read a lot of CQC reports about various care homes
You can see where people have done things better or worse than you
Under the heading of care it often states that the residents are appropriately dressed - strange at first sight but actually is a good indication of care.
Pulled up one time for a resident wearing a combination of garish clothes
Humans are good at making their own minds up and working things out.
People going to Jesus and asking whether he was the Messiah
Jesus showing people in lots of ways how he loved them and cared for them
Perhaps we need to look for Jesus in all things and follow the signs.

25:00 - Hymn MP 1008 The Lord’s my shepherd (Townsend version)

28:27 - 30:21 - Reading: Acts 9. 36 - 43 NIVUK 

30:24 - Hymn R&amp;S 277 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

33:33 - 49:40 - Address
The reputation of sheep for not being the brightest in the world
Christians getting annoyed when compared to sheep
Sheep seeking security of the flock and following the shepherd
Knowing their shepherd
Needing a leader, someone to guide them
We are like that, needing Jesus
Jesus provides the security of an eternal kingdom
Christianity is not about Christians behaving themselves, it's about hope for those who have none
That's us - filled with doubt and fear, having to cut through uncertainty and ambiguity to belief
Terry Kelly - songwriter from Nova Scotia - In my Father's House
When we are with God, he provides the sanctuary from life's storms, all we have to do is come inside with faith

50:09 - Hymn R&amp;S 552 The King of love my shepherd is

53:34 - Prayers of intercession

24:10 - Introduction to our theme – called to love
Last week I was on a supervision course online thinking how we care for each other and supervise ministers and Christian leaders in the future

46:17 - Hymn R&amp;S Christ is alive

48:58 - 01:00:25 - Short Address
Christ is alive, no longer bound to years in Palestine
Today we have heard how the risen Jesus touched the lives of Peter and the other fisherman.
Touched the life of Paul as he went with murderous threats to Damascus and changed his life
Stories of transformation from failure - &quot;they are fishermen, surely they should be able to catch some fish&quot; Jesus shows them how to move from catching fish to catching people. drawing people into the loving grace and peace of God.
Peter so full of regret and guilt after the denial of Jesus, that night must have been terrible for him
Proclaiming he would go to his death yet when the moment came, his courage failed.
Saul is asked &quot;why are you persecuting me?&quot;
These stories are not just about a distant past, they resonate today with Jesus touching every place and person.
How will Jesus touch our lives today?  Dramatically, gently, mysteriously?

01:00:26 - Prayers for the church and the world

01:03:54 - Hymn R&amp;S 243 Now the green blade rises

28:50 - WE LISTEN FOR GOD’S WORD

29:11 - 32:40 - Reading 1 - John 20:19-31 

33:00 - Hymn: R&amp;S 552 From Heaven You came helpless babe 
 the third verse reflect the words of doubting Thomas.

37:36 - ALL AGE TALK – What’s in a nickname?.
We often don't know what our nicknames are unless they are polite
Our reading today from John's gospel makes it clear that Thomas has at least one nickname - Thomas the Doubter
Thomas did a lot of courageous and resilient things but is left with the abiding impression of the doubter
Not all doubts are bad
Doubting the claims of cold callers from &quot;Microsoft&quot;
Asking questions to confirm or quell doubts
Thomas did the same - had doubts but didn't keep them to himself and simply asked questions to clarify
Doubting whether God exists but doing nothing to test them, instead just living with the doubts.

43:24 - 45:48 - Reading 2 – Acts 5:27-32 

46:01 - 01:01:28 - Sermon: -  I wish I was more like Thomas!
In all of our services before and immediately after Easter, there are a number of people who get a bad press for their actions.
Most of the disciples and particularly Thomas get this.  
It's clear that none of the disciples came through this period with flying colours.  Judas, Peter, most of the rest running a mile when the going got tough.
So when Thomas comes in for criticism, he's not the only one who fails.
In the lent readings this year, the words used to describe the disciples was &quot;failed&quot;
Thinking that if God can work and live through failed disciples, maybe he can work and live through us
Looking in the reading where Jesus appears to the disciples less Thomas and Judas and then to them including Thomas
When Jesus appeared to the first group, he did three things - showed his wounds, commissioned them, and then breathed on them so they could receive the Holy Spirit.  So even before the disciples could question who this person was, Jesus gave them proof that he had risen.
&quot;As the Father sent me, so I send you&quot; - showing how God was dependent on the disciples to spread his word. 
That they had free will and had mutual dependency with Jesus
Tradition has it that Thomas was allocated India as his territory to convert and the St Thomas Christians today can trace themselves back to Thomas.
5 points to close
- Thomas is a clear example to us ass of how we are to fulfill Christ's commission today
- When we look at the ragbag collection of the Disciples, it must give us confidence that we too can be His disciples
- Do not be afraid of doubt and do not let it be a cover for dithering
- Clearly express your doubts and share them in fellowship
- Remember that our mission will be tough but with God's help it will not defeat us

This is the Good News – the grave is empty, Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!
This is the Good News – the light shines in the darkness
And the darkness can never put it out, for Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!
This is the Good News – once we were no people, but now we are God’s people, living the new life, for Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!
This is the Good News – Christ is our peace, the indestructible peace that touches us now and lifts our hearts in worship, 
for Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!

16:14 - Hymn 232 Christ the Lord is risen today omit verses 4 and 5

19:48 - Prayer of adoration 

21:42 - Introduction: ‘the great Easter Harvest’
So the long journey of Lent is over
Overshadowed for us this year by the terrible war in Ukraine
A wooden sculpture with a cross carved out backlit by sunshine and casting a shadow
A picture of the open tomb
A picture of a sunflower seed
Growing sunflowers
Linked to to Ukrainian sunflower harvest
The reading today telling how all this began on that great Easter morning

29:09 - 31:09 - Reading: Luke 24. 1 – 12 (NIVUK) read by Jeany Bien

38:05 - Worship songs -    MP 14  All heaven declares
MP 220  He is Lord (1 verse sung twice)

42:17 - 54:45 - Short Address: ‘Women, Wondering, Words, Way, Witness’
 Each of the gospels bring their own angle on the story of Jesus, especially true as the story approaches Easter
John with the upper room, Matthew with an earthquake, Mark's abrupt account, Luke's story of the great meeting on the Emmaus road
Who are the ones who hear the good news first that Jesus is living - not the men who represent the patriarchy of the time, not the high priests, it's the faithful women who come to anoint the body
Even now the place of women in the church is not as it should be
The women are the great witnesses
Getting caught up with political, military or financial power and not hearing the voices of women
People wanting to be positive to trans-gender men and women whilst balancing the need to avoid belittling more than half of the world's population and ceasing to use the word women
God has raised Jesus, praise be to our risen Lord 

54:49 - Prayer of confession with the responses
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.
Christ have mercy: Christ have mercy.
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.
 
57:05 - Song MP 387 Jesus we celebrate your victory 

Prayer offering our lives for God’s work today

Living and Loving God, we come with our gifts
to offer the praise of our lips
and the service of our lives
through Jesus Christ 
our risen Lord and mighty Saviour.  Amen. 

01:01:40 - Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at church (or at home) united in the name of Christ.

17:40 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

19:53 - 23:58 - Talk for all ages – from the point of view of the donkey
Imagine being a donkey in a village a couple of miles from Jerusalem
Still very young
Learning from your mother how to carry people and other burdens
Being asked for specifically
Setting off for Jerusalem
Feeling the excitement 
Hearing the crowds
All the noise and confusion
A special passenger

24:33 - Hymn R&amp;S 209 Ride on! Ride on in majesty 

26:32 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:

27:15 - 28:50 - Reading   Psalm 118 : 19-29 read by Arthur Winning

29:03 - 30:44 - Reading Luke 19: 28-42 read by Linda Curley

30:54 - Hymn R&amp;S 528  Jesus good above all other

33:53 - 47:00 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
Palm Sunday is one of the few stories recorded in all 4 gospels
All 4 writers had their own agenda and were addressing different audiences
As with Christmas, we tend to combine all of the stories together
Luke says nothing about palms of the crowd shouting hosannah, he only records people using cloaks to cover the donkey and the path
He misquotes psalm 118 with &quot;blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord&quot; when it reads &quot;blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord&quot;.  Luke has a theme of kingship in his gospel
Jesus was coming with a mission of peace, not what the crowd seem to be hoping for, calling to be saved form the hated occupiers
Jesus was coming humbly, in accordance with God's calling - what will they do with a messiah who comes in peace
This was Jesus' last, loving appeal to the people as he approached a place that had a special place in his heart
Does this event present any challenge to us today?
Who can we identify with?
Would we cheer, switch to shouting &quot;crucify&quot; in a few days?  Would we join with the disciples?
What would we have made of Jesus' tears and what do we make of them today
As we follow the story in the coming week, remember that we don't have to wait until the end of the week, we know the joy of resurrection and can welcome Jesus as the messiah into our lives now.

38:50 - 52:45 - Short Address: ‘Jesus – the anointed one’
The journey of Lent this year has been overshadowed by the horrific invasion of Ukraine
The world feels a darker and more fragile place
So we turn to the story of Jesus that can speak powerfully into our situation today
He lived in an occupied nation where a brutal regime imposed its power by force, crucifying thousands as a demonstration of strength
People of faith questioned why God had not liberated them
Injustice and corruption were rife
Into this chaos came Jesus, his integrity shone through confronting the authorities, challenging the religious leaders. For many, God was a small tribal God but Jesus introduced a God whose love knew no limit
Sometimes the weight of that ministry must have been too heavy to bear - sometimes he withdrew to Bethany to the homes of friends Martha and Mary.
According to John it was here he was anointed with precious oil.
In Luke the story appears earlier
For John, the anointing of Jesus, preparing him for all that is to come happens in a safe space in the home of friends.
Jesus stands up for Mary, refusing to allow her to be bullied by Judas.
&quot;You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me&quot;
Today, we need to stand up for those who are bullied or oppressed.  That is what Jesus does for each one of us, for all humanity

58:58 - Prayer of confession
Forgive us, faithful God,
when we fill the rooms we enter with negativity, not warmth:
Forgive us, and fill us with love.
Forgive us when we justify our reluctance to give and share,
blaming others rather than ourselves:
Forgive us, and fill us with love
Forgive us when we are slow to express gratitude,
and take what we have for granted.
Forgive us, and fill us with love.
In the name of the anointed One, Jesus Christ. Amen.
Be assured in the name of Jesus: Our sins are forgiven; we can
begin again, renewed by God’s Spirit. Thanks be to God. Amen.
