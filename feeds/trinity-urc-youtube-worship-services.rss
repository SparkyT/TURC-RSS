We come before God held in the knowledge we are loved,

Loving shepherd, we come to you to confess

shepherd. Times we allow our busyness to drive us from
places of rest.
Times we choose paths of discord rather than loving
kindness.
Times we embrace despair rather than hope
Jesus is the good shepherd who has pity on his flock
And promises goodness and love will be with us
Follow your shepherd on the right paths,
And do so in the knowledge you are loved and forgiven.
Amen.

17:55 - 22:34 - Introduction: ‚ÄòElijah the outsider‚Äô

23:21 - 25:07 - Reading: 1 Kings 17. 1 ‚Äì 10 read by Rosemary Taylor

25:35 - 36:30 - Talk: ‚ÄòFed by the ravens!‚Äô
The importance of serving God, not idols or selfish interests, like Elijah served the God of Israel.
The story of Elijah being fed by ravens highlights humanity's interconnectedness with nature.
Questioning the belief that humans are superior to nature and can live without it.
The story of the widow's unending flour and oil symbolizes God's provision in times of scarcity.
The valuable role of the poor widow in helping Elijah.
Jesus referenced the story of the widow, praising those who give even a cup of water.
The need for recognizing interdependence and reliance on God.
Jesus' teaching about God's care for even small sparrows.
Praying to God as a caring, heavenly Father.

Pause: ‚ÄòHappy Father‚Äôs Day!‚Äô

36:48 - Lord‚Äôs Prayer

37:40 - 40:29 - HYMN R&amp;S 64 I lift my eyes to the quiet hills

40:40 - 44:00 - Consider:¬†How do you react to a crisis or a danger in your
life? Do you prefer to ‚Äòfight‚Äô or prefer ‚Äòflight‚Äô or simply
‚Äòfreeze‚Äô?!

44:04 - 47:06 - Reading: 1 Kings 19.9 ‚Äì 20a read by Norma Garden

47:19 - 57:44 - Reflection: ‚Äòmeeting God in the silence‚Äô
Elijah depressed and in self-pity after his triumph over the prophets of Baal.
Elijah catastrophized, feeling alone and that everyone had deserted him except for God.
God questioned Elijah's presence in the cave, calling him out of his despair and isolation.
Rather than appearing in dramatic natural phenomena, God came to Elijah in a &quot;gentle whisper&quot; or &quot;still small voice.&quot;
Contrast the noise of our world with the stark silence Elijah experienced in the cave.
Silence is challenging yet powerful, allowing space for God's voice amidst the inner noise of thoughts.
Different translations describing God's voice as a &quot;soft whisper,&quot; &quot;sound of sheer silence,&quot; and &quot;still small voice.&quot;
Elijah realized he was in the presence of the holy God, covering his face in response.
God met Elijah not in dramatic displays but in the stillness and quiet whisper.


Ponder: ‚ÄòWe spend most of our lives focussed on three
verbs: to want, to have and to do. But none of these verbs
has any ultimate significance until it is transcended by and
included in the fundamental verb: to be.‚Äô (Evelyn Underhill)

58:25 - 01:00:32 - HYMN MP 48 Be still and know that I am God

01:00:59 - Further Exploration: ‚ÄòJesus and Elijah‚Äô

01:03:26 - 01:05:53 - Reading: Matthew 17. 1 ‚Äì 13 read by Terry

01:06:11 - 01:10:58 - HYMN R&amp;amp;S 492 Dear Lord and Father of mankind

01:11:19 - 01:18:48 - Prayers for the church and the world using verses of
HYMN TP 56 Kum ba ya

01:19:04 - 01:21:59 - HYMN R&amp;S 531 Lord of all hopefulness

14:08 - 16:00 - Prayer of adoration and confession 

16:08 - 24:49 - Introduction for all ages: ‚ÄòNothing like a good story‚Äô
Favourite stories, parables, and losing things

25:27 - 27:02 - Reading: Luke 15. 1 ‚Äì 10 NIVUK read by Lesley Bogart

29:14 - 31:17 - HYMN CP 695  God has given us a book full of stories
31:25 - 33:06 - TP 31  Give thanks with a grateful heart
(Activities for children are available during the service)


34:18 - 39:41 - Talk - Prophets
The role of prophets in ancient Israel, including major and minor prophets in the Old and New Testaments.
Prophets were honest truth-tellers close to God, sometimes speaking out at great personal cost.
Prophecy involved discerning the signs of the times and God's wisdom, not just future predictions.
There were also female prophets like Miriam, Deborah, and Isaiah's wife, though less known.
The story of the prophet Nathan confronting King David over his sin with Bathsheba is examined.
David abused his power by summoning Bathsheba and impregnating her, then ordering her husband Uriah's death.
Nathan uses a parable to make David realize his guilt before directly accusing him.
The prophets called for repentance and change, as the future was not set.
David repents after Nathan's confrontation, though he still faces consequences.
Prophecy involved speaking truth to power, even to kings who could have the prophet killed.

40:00 - 42:21 - Reading: 2 Samuel 12. 1 ‚Äì 10 NIVUK read by Ian Bogart

43:35 - 47:37 - HYMN R&amp;S 621  Almighty Father

47:41 - 01:00:06 - Short Address 
Jesus was dismissed as just a carpenter when he returned to his hometown of Nazareth, but he embraced the title of prophet.
Honoring the prophets and hearing what they have to say, especially during political campaigns filled with empty words and promises.
The story of the prophet Nathan confronting King David about his sin with Bathsheba is examined.
Nathan uses a parable to make David realize his own guilt before directly accusing him, showing the power of stories.
Prophets are called to speak truth to power, even at great personal risk.
There are consequences for sin, as seen in David's family being divided by conflict after his actions.
However, genuine repentance like David's leads to God's forgiveness, though consequences may still remain.
A parallel between the injustice done to the poor man's lamb and the injustice of Jesus' death.
Encouraging hearing the stories of the poor and marginalized in society.
Despite sin and tragedy, there is hope for a new beginning through God's grace and truth.

01:01:29 - 01:06:27 - Prayers of intercession with the response
Lord, may your kingdom of justice and joy come:
your loving will be done.

Communion: all invited to share in the bread and wine (non-alcoholic grape juice) to remember Jesus.

00:00 - Music before the service

03:21 - Entry of the Bible

03:37 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

05:48 - Call to Worship (Psalm 27. 1 ‚Äì 4)

06:50 - 10:46 - HYMN R&amp;S 121 The God of Abraham praise

11:19 - Opening Prayers
Lord‚Äôs Prayer

14:16 - 17:07 - Reading: John 3. 1 ‚Äì 17 read by Alan Yates

17:19 - 22:03 - Introduction to the service (All age talk)
The film &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; starring Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle.
In the film, two criminals disguise themselves as nuns to hide in a convent after a bank robbery.
The Mother Superior allows them to stay but requires them to work like the other nuns.
A humorous scene where Eric Idle's character, Sister Immaculata, tries to explain the Holy Trinity to a class of teenage girls.
Sister Immaculata uses a three-leaf clover to illustrate the concept of the Trinity.
A triangle, being a strong shape, can represent the strength and self-supporting nature of the Trinity.
Parallels between the three sides of the triangle and the three persons of the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
The Trinity is a difficult concept for humans to fully understand.
However, the triangle analogy can help provide a partial understanding of how God can be three persons in one.
Think about the triangle next time you contemplate the Trinity, as it represents God's ability to be Father, Son, and Holy Spirit simultaneously.

22:15 - 25:47 - HYMN R&amp;S 34 Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty

26:00 - 27:12 - Reading: Romans 8. 12 ‚Äì 17 read by Kate Yates

27:31 - 34:16 - HYMN R&amp;amp;S 36 I bind unto myself today

34:25 - 42:58 - Address
The comedy series Dad's Army and a humorous scene about choir admission forms.
The ancient Athanasian Creed, which explains the doctrine of the Holy Trinity.
The Creed stresses that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, yet distinct persons.
The Trinity is a difficult concept for many Christians to comprehend.
However, the Trinity represents a model of perfect balance, communion, and relationship within God.
There is no domination or power struggle among the three persons, only absolute love.
The Trinitarian relationship is meant to be an example for human relationships and love.
Through Christ, believers are mysteriously drawn into this relationship of divine love.
The Trinity is not just an academic doctrine but part of the believer's experience of God.
The image of God as a loving Trinity is stamped into human beings from creation.

43:28 - 46:05 - HYMN R&amp;S 38 Thou Whose Almighty word

46:10 - 51:40 - Prayers of intercession

51:59 - 54:39 - HYMN R&amp;S 405 Angel voices ever singing

54:39 - 55:01 - Blessing

55:25 - 59:10 - Music after the service

17:49 - 19:18 - Reading: John 15. 1 ‚Äì 8 read by Sue Thorne

19:26 - 23:22 - Introduction to the service (All age talk)
Not being much of a gardener and finding it a waste of time
An exception was a small plant grown from a single leaf given out at an Easter Sunday service a few years ago.
The leaf was told to be planted upside down in potting compost, and surprisingly it took root and grew into a sizable plant.
This plant taught the lesson that we need to be part of something - specifically, attached to Jesus who is the true vine.
Jesus provides the life-giving energy and sustenance for us to bear good fruit and do his work.
If we take this seriously and do the work Jesus desires, our spiritual fruit would multiply and increase our impact.
Jesus said he is the true vine, and God the Father is the gardener who prunes the branches.
Branches must remain attached to the vine (Jesus) to receive the life-giving sap and produce fruit.
To bear the fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, etc., we must stay connected to Jesus as our source.
It is important to stay in touch with Jesus every single day of our lives to receive his life in us.

23:32 - 26:34 - Hymn R&amp;S 234 Alleluia, alleluia, give thanks

27:10 - 30:40 - Reading: Acts 8. 26 ‚Äì 40 read by John Hillson

30:59 - 34:01 - Hymn R&amp;S 71 O God of Bethel, by whose hand

34:32 - 46:06 - Address
Two important words to consider today - inclusivity and diversity
Policies and actions need to be evaluated for promoting inclusivity and diversity for all people regardless of gender, family situation, disability, lifestyle, or racial background.
The Gospel story challenges us to consider the radical inclusivity and diversity of God's love revealed in Jesus.
The Ethiopian eunuch was a powerful court official who was physically impotent/castrated, likely non-Jewish and from the ancient kingdom of Kush.
He was reading Isaiah's suffering servant prophecies about Jesus, but was excluded from the Jerusalem temple as a eunuch.
Yet Isaiah promises inclusion for foreigners and eunuchs who keep God's covenant.
This prefigures the church's expansion from Jewish followers of Jesus to the whole world.
The eunuch, excluded from societal binaries, may have been nearer to God and invited Philip to join him.
Like Philip, the church needs to be open to meeting people on their territory, not just inviting them into church buildings.

45:39 - 49:08 - Reading: 1 Corinthians 15.35 ‚Äì 45, 51 ‚Äì 58 
read by Sarah and Norma

49:16 - 56:10 - Talk - ‚Äòunfolding a mystery‚Äô
The passage (1 Corinthians 15) begins and ends with questions about resurrection and the defeat of death.
Paul delights in the diversity and splendor of the natural world.
Resurrection is not about endless, indefinite life extension, but transformation into a new, imperishable existence.
What is perishable, dishonorable, weak, and natural will be raised imperishable, glorious, powerful, and spiritual - a mystery beyond our imagination.
Death is a fundamental reality of human existence, but not the final reality; God revealed in the risen Christ is the final reality.
We are all diminished by each person's death, but connected through the risen Jesus who brings hope.
John Donne's poem depicting death as temporary: &quot;one short sleep past, we wake eternally.&quot;
Drawing from Isaiah, Paul declares death is &quot;swallowed up in victory&quot; through Christ's resurrection.
The &quot;sting&quot; of death is sin, but God gives ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.
Our labor for God's kingdom is not in vain, bearing fruit in this life and beyond, when we live in hope, faith, and eternal love.

56:30 - 59:10 - Hymn Now the green blade rises

59:14 - 01:04:36 - Prayers of thanksgiving and intercession with the response
Lord of all life: hear our prayer. 

01:04:52 - 01:07:33 - Hymn - R&amp;S 260  Christ is alive! 

01:07:34 - 01:08:06 - Blessing

01:08:33 - 01:12:40 - Music after the service

28:39 - 30:14 - 2nd Reading: Acts 3. 12 ‚Äì 19 read by Ian Bogart

30:41 - 34:18 - Hymn R&amp;amp;S 373: Lord Jesus Christ, you have come to us

34:25 - 52:17 - Address - followed by time of quiet reflection
The apparent doubt experienced by the disciples when Jesus appeared to them after his resurrection.
The disciples' doubt is encouraging, as it shows that it's okay to have doubts in one's faith.
The external context and events that can bring doubts into people's minds, but God is not responsible for these.
The core message of the Gospel, which is that Jesus died so that people can repent and be forgiven.
The concept of being &quot;justified&quot; by Christ's death on the cross, meaning that one is seen as if they had never sinned.
The message of repentance and forgiveness of sins is central to the Gospel, as seen in the passages from Luke and Acts.
What would we have done if Jesus had lived among us - people can sometimes be carried away by the crowd.
Regardless of past actions, people can be forgiven by God if they truly repent.
The commission Jesus gave to his disciples, which is to share the good news and encourage people to repent and be forgiven.
Allow the Holy Spirit to open their minds to the scriptures and empower them to share the Gospel message.

17:48 - 20:51 - Introduction to the service (All age talk)
Jesus' welcome into Jerusalem
Jesus received a triumphant welcome into Jerusalem, with people waving palm branches and shouting &quot;Hosanna!&quot;
The crowd welcomed Jesus as the new King, expecting him to overthrow the Romans and establish God's kingdom.
We can be like that crowd, getting excited about Jesus and promising to work for his kingdom.
We pray, worship, give, and strive to live loving and honest lives in service to God's will.
Yet the same crowd that praised Jesus also turned on him, shouting &quot;Crucify him!&quot;
There are times when we similarly reject Jesus' way of love, humility, and obedience.
In those moments, we join the crowd calling for Jesus' crucifixion.
We struggle to fully embrace the demands of God's kingdom when it conflicts with our desires.
The call is to consistently live &quot;Hosanna!&quot; with our lives, not rejecting Christ's lordship.
We must continually realign our hearts to receive Jesus as King, not just in celebratory moments.


21:05 - 23:09 - Hymn Ride on ride on in majesty

Blessing as Junior Church leave.
 
24:16 - 26:58 - Reading Mark 14. 1 ‚Äì 15 NIVUK read by Kitty 

27:17 - 31:20 - Hymn As Royal banners are unfurled
(Tune Gonfalon Royal)

31:56 - 45:32 - Address - From Palms to Passion: A Holy Week Journey
We are called to embrace the solemn and reflective nature of Lent as a season of repentance and preparation.
We witness the climax of the passion narrative during Holy Week, accompanying Jesus from his triumphal entry to his crucifixion and resurrection.
we recognize the extravagant act of the woman who anointed Jesus with expensive perfume as a beautiful expression of devotion.
We are challenged to move beyond the &quot;market mind&quot; that sees such acts as wasteful, and instead appreciate the spiritual value.
We are invited to lift your worship and service to the level of beauty, going beyond the minimum with unsolicited gifts of love.
We are encouraged to do what you can, even if it seems unexciting or unspectacular, as that is often the highest achievement.
We are reminded that true discipleship involves transforming duty into the maximum of beauty through the &quot;fine excess&quot; of imagination and love.
We are called to echo the hosannas that proclaimed Jesus as the long-awaited King during his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
We are urged to accompany Jesus on his journey from Palm Sunday to Easter, immersing yourselves in the profound liturgies and symbolism.
We are exhorted to live out the self-giving, unmeasured generosity exemplified by the woman who anointed Jesus.

45:57 - 49:44 - Hymn When I survey the wondrous cross

49:49 - 54:26 - Prayers of intercession

54:45 - 56:53 - Hymn In the cross of Christ I glory

56:53 - 57:15 - Blessing
