People were always looking for Jesus, but he would withdraw to pray and recharge.
These words can help discover the healing that comes through faith in God.

24:43 Hymn - R&amp;S 332 Jesus lover of my soul

29:10 - 38:38 - Address
Reflecting on school days and strict teachers like the headmaster who also served in church.
The Bible passage about Jesus' teaching makes us think about impactful teachers.
Jesus taught with authority unlike the rabbis who referenced earlier teachings.
Jesus was confident in his identity as God's Son which integrated his character and teaching.
We should also be ready to give account of our hope without just appealing to the past.
Jesus' words had immediate impact, like healing the man. His message was freedom.
Jesus walked the walk, not just talked. We should have integrating words and actions.
Jesus earned authority by freeing and helping people, not from any office.
We need to know our beloved identity in Christ through baptism and worship.
Our everyday words and actions should bring God's kingdom like Jesus did.
We are reminded to internalize our Christian identity so that our actions align with our words in bringing positive change, rather than relying solely on past teaching.

07:53 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

09:37 - Call to worship

10:27 - 12:22 - Hymn - R&amp;S 565 Jesus stand among us

12:25 - Prayer of adoration
14:17 - Lord’s Prayer

15:00 - 28:18 - Introduction for all ages: ‘You’re welcome.’
Material for the week prepared by Christians in Burkina Faso focused on the Good Samaritan parable and loving your neighbor. 
Burkina Faso is experiencing major unrest and terrorism, with over 2 million displaced people.
Links to a couple previously held hostage there that we prayed for. 
The importance of welcoming others, like Abraham and Sarah showing hospitality to angel visitors. Ways to welcome include providing refreshments and making people comfortable.


28:48 - 30:05 - Reading: Genesis 18:1-8 Good News

WORSHIP SONGS
31:22 - MP 1221 Praise is rising
34:39 - MP 1046 Give thanks to the Lord our God and King

48:33 - 01:00:32 - Address - The Transforming Power of Love for Neighbour
The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us the meaning of loving our neighbor
The Good Samaritan went far beyond what was expected to care for the wounded stranger
We should not just pass by those in need but stop and truly help
Unity and reconciliation are needed in divided communities like Burkina Faso
Christians there are working together across denominations to help displaced people
We must have hope - &quot;the moment of reconciliation will come&quot;
The command to love God and neighbor matters more than religious laws and debates
We must move from seeing &quot;neighbor&quot; as a noun to becoming a neighbor through action
We can collaborate to be Good Samaritans addressing desperation in our own communities
Love never ends - it bears, believes, hopes and endures all things
Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan, focusing on the Samaritan's loving action towards the wounded stranger. This radical care for neighbor should inspire Christians today, even in divided communities, to work together in reconciliation and service. 

01:00:33 - Affirmation of Love (verses from 1 Corinthians 13)

of the Chemin Neuf Community)
Lord Jesus, who prayed that all might be one,
we pray to you for the unity of all Christians,
according to your will, according to your means.
May your Spirit enable us to experience
the suffering caused by division,
to see our sin and to hope beyond all hope. Amen.

01:11:58 - 01:14:02 - Hymn R&amp;S 647 In Christ there is no East or West

01:14:03 - 01:14:28 - Blessing

01:14:55 - 01:18:34 - Music after the service
