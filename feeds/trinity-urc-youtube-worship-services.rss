Introduction to Bible readings

Readings: Isaiah 61.1-4, 8-11 read by Kitty Bird

PSALM 126 read by minister and all
It seemed like a dream, too good to be true,
    when GOD returned Zion’s exiles.
We laughed, we sang,
    we couldn’t believe our good fortune.
We were the talk of the nations—
    “GOD was wonderful to them!”
GOD was wonderful to us;
    we are one happy people.
4-6  And now, GOD, do it again—
    bring rains to our drought-stricken lives
So those who planted their crops in despair
    will shout “Yes!” at the harvest,
So those who went off with heavy hearts
    will come home laughing, with armloads of blessing.
Thanks be to God for his word of hope and life.

Reading: John 1.6-18 read by Norma Garden

03:35 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

04:39 - Short time of quiet to prepare for worship

14:32 - Lighting of the Advent Candle and prayer 

We light our first candle, as a sign of our hope that peace and justice will
come to our world.  Normally on this Sunday we light our second candle
to give thanks for the Bible that is indeed a light to guide and inspire us. 
This second candle is also known as the Bethlehem Candle.  This Advent
and Christmas all the lights that normally decorate Bethlehem, the
birthplace of Jesus, will remain unlit, because on the ongoing war in the
region.  We and United Reformed Churches across the country have
been invited to leave the second candle unlit all the way through Advent,
including Christmas Day, as a reminder that we stand in solidarity with all
those who are suffering in the Holy Land – of all faiths and none – and all
who are striving for bring an end to war, hatred and bitterness.
God of hope, come to us again this Advent.

May your Word be a lamp to our feet
and a light on our path. May peace and justice
come to the land of Jesus’ birth and the lights of
Bethlehem shine bright again. Amen.

16:59 - 19:25 - Hymn R&amp;S 134 One Jordon&amp;#39;s bank the Baptists cry

Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and we
share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and also with you) or

Introduction to Bible readings

20:20 - 22:24 - Reading: Isaiah 40. 1 – 11 read by Ian Bogart

22:31 - 23:58 - Reading: 2 Peter 3. 8 – 14 read by Lesley Bogart

24:15 - 26:39 - Hymn R&amp;S 137 Hark the glad sound the Saviour comes

26:52 - 40:39 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection
The passage from Isaiah 40 provides comfort after judgment and suffering.
There is a shift to the post-exile era, with God promising to return to Jerusalem.
God's glory will be revealed again after a period of being hidden.
The prophet seeks to reassure the people of God's faithfulness.
God will return with might and will shepherd his people gently.
True comfort emerges from acknowledging suffering and the reality of sin.
We must turn ourselves fully over to God, like a lamb in the shepherd's arms.
The image of the good shepherd can seem intimidating rather than comforting.
Advent confronts the harsh realities of life before offering comfort.
We should not avoid discomfort in order to appreciate God's grace.

This thought-provoking sermon digs deep into the meaning of comfort in Isaiah 40. Facing the difficult realities of human weakness, it explores how God's care emerges through discomfort to offer true peace.

41:09 - 44:50 - Hymn R&amp;S 140 O Lord how shall I meet you

45:10 - 50:50 - Prayers of intercession (including an offering prayer)

00:00 Music, notices, and photos

02:25 - Entry of the bible

02:40 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle , followed by a short time of quiet to prepare for worship

06:50 - Call to worship Psalm 95.1-7a

09:11 - 12:05 - Hymn Come let us praise the Lord  (Tune R&amp;S 657 Gopsal)

12:17 - 15:09 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

15:19 - 20:31 - Talk for all ages “The King is coming …”
A king sent word he would visit a small village.
The mayor prepared banners and tidied up to welcome the king.
But the king arrived disguised as a thirsty beggar asking for water.
The mayor brushed him aside, waiting for the real king who never came.
The mayor then learned the beggar was the king in disguise.
This story shows Jesus is present in every person we meet.
We should be kind to all, as we can't tell who Jesus will appear as.
At judgment, acts of kindness will matter more than status or wealth.
Seeing Jesus in others means serving without expecting reward.
It's failing to show love that makes us sheep or goats.

Through a simple story, the pastor conveyed that God calls us to serve the people right in front of us, regardless of status or appeal. Citing Jesus’ teaching that service to the “least” is accepted as service to God, it challenges the notion that worthiness should impact our willingness to meet basic needs with compassion. Christ himself ministers incognito in this world, reaching out through those deemed insignificant. The message – live expecting to glimpse divine glory in ordinary encounters.


20:42 - Hymn From heaven you came
 
26:00 - 28:34 - Reading: Matthew 25. 31-46 read by David 
The Sheep and the Goats


28:42 - 30:10 - Reading: Ephesians 1. 15-23 read by Valerie
Thanksgiving and Prayer


30:44 - 34:02 - Hymn Crown him with many crowns

35:16 - 01:01:34 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
The last 7 weeks have been difficult with events in the Middle East. It's hard not to ask &quot;where is God in this?&quot;.
But we know suffering is not God's doing - it's man's inhumanity to man.
We join the voices of lament and cries for help that have gone up for millennia.
Yet Scripture gives the full picture - God has promised to never abandon us.
Christ the King Sunday - Pope Pius XI established this feast to counter secularism and political leaders' supremacy claims.
The Bible readings clearly point to Christ's kingship and authority.
Jesus tells a story indicating the criteria for judgement will be acts of kindness to those in need.
We should see Jesus in the people we encounter and serve.
It's the good we fail to do that will determine whether we are sheep or goats.

This timely sermon on Christ the King Sunday calls us to look for Jesus in &quot;the least of these&quot; we encounter daily. Though lamenting recent tragic world events clearly stemming from humanity's brokenness, the preacher reminds us God suffers with victims of injustice and violence. While not ignoring the reality of evil, he focuses the message on our responsibility as followers of Christ to live out simple kindness and compassion. Using Jesus' parable of the sheep and goats, he makes clear we ignore this call at our eternal peril. Our criteria for judgment is caring for those in need with selfless, unconditional love as Christ modeled.

01:01:50 - Hymn - The Lord’s my shepherd (Townend version)

20:10 - Faithful One, so unchanging MP 825

24:05 - Introducing the reading

25:30 - 26:45 - Reading Mark 4.35 – 41 (Good News) read by Larry Ogbewe

26:56 - 31:27 - Short talk; picture yourself in the boat with Jesus
Jesus often traveled, moving from village to village to share the good news.
One day Jesus had been teaching from a boat because there was no room on the shore.
After a long day of teaching parables, Jesus said let's go to the other side of the sea.
There were other boats traveling with Jesus and his disciples.
Imagine yourself as a disciple in the boat with Jesus. The boat is a symbol of the church.
A painting called Mystical Boat depicts two figures in a boat - a sailor and companion, like Jesus and disciples.
Think of yourself as the sailor with Jesus as your companion.
The sail reflects God's glory, the spirit blows the boat forward despite choppy waters.
The gospel reminds us we're on a journey of life and faith, with Jesus as our guide.
Jesus brightens and guides our lives.
In his travels, Jesus often taught from a boat when crowds gathered at the seashore. After a long day sharing parables, he sailed across the sea with his disciples. Though the waters were choppy, Jesus was there to steady the boat, just as he guides us through the rough waters of life. The boat reminds us that we're on a journey of faith, with Christ as our companion. Whatever storms we face, he navigates our course, shining like a beacon to give us hope. We must trust Jesus to see us through to the other side

31:30 - Activity at tables – make a paper boat (write your name on one
side and Jesus on the other, decorate etc)

42:27 - Song Jesus be the centre MP 1076

44:56 - COFFEE AND PASTRIES SERVED AT THE TABLES / TIME OF
FELLOWSHIP

54:01 - 54:43 - Return to the reading: Mark 4.37 – 38 read by Alan Yates

54:49 - 56:23 - Short Talk: Is Jesus sleeping?
The story leaves us thinking about the disciples in the boat when they thought Jesus didn't care they were going to die.
Storms suddenly hit us in life - physical storms with erratic weather.
We use the image of storms to describe challenges we and humanity and the church face.
With Jesus we have power to rebuke the storms and say &quot;Peace, be still!&quot;
Though the seas rage, Jesus calms the storms in our lives.
Sudden storms arise in our lives, both physical and metaphorical. As a church, we face many raging storms - division, decline, disillusionment. But just as Jesus calmed the storm for the disciples, he can bring stillness to our chaos. We must keep our eyes fixed on him, not the choppy seas of challenge nor our sinking hopes. Though the tempests won't cease, in the boat with Christ we find peace. Through the power of prayer we can rebuke the storms and proclaim &quot;Peace, be still!&quot; Jesus alone can calm the tempests in our hearts and grant us safe passage through the raging floods.


Activity ‘Storms and challenges of life’ – sharing at table areas for prayer for yourself or for others; each table to write these on a sheet and bring up for closing prayers.

08:42 - 17:52 - Talk For All Ages
It's Remembrance Sunday - we remember those who died in war.
Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan.
A man was robbed and left injured on the road to Jericho.
A priest and Levite passed by without helping.
A Samaritan stopped and helped the injured man.
Samaritans were disliked by Jews but showed love.
Jesus said to love our neighbor, even enemies.
We must remember to love all people.
Remembrance means loving those different than us.
Jesus calls us to love our neighbors and enemies.
Today's all age talk for Remembrance Sunday reflects on Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan. Though robbed and left injured, the Jewish man was passed by a priest and Levite of his own faith. Yet he was shown love and care by a Samaritan, an enemy group despised by Jews. 
Jesus highlighted that we are to remember to love all people, even those perceived as enemies or outcasts. 
As we remember the sacrifice of those who died in war this Remembrance Sunday, we must also remember Jesus' call to love our neighbors and enemies alike.

35:18 - 47:57 - Sermon - Remembrance - But what are we to remember?
Today's sermon focuses on remembrance and God's law.
The prophets warned Israel about forgetting God's law.
Leaders were corrupt and exploited people.
Israel and Judah were conquered for disobedience.
Jesus later taught the essence of God's law.
He taught radical love and forgiveness.
Love God and love your neighbor as yourself.
Your neighbor includes your enemies.
Jesus set the example by forgiving his enemies.
We must also love and forgive our enemies and those who wrong us.

Today's sermon centers on the theme of remembrance, specifically calling us to remember God's law. The prophets like Micah warned the people of Israel and Judah not to forget or disobey God's commands. 
Yet they experienced punishment and exile when leaders exploited the people. Jesus later taught the core of God's law is to radically love others, even enemies who wrong you. 
He set the example by forgiving his enemies while dying on the cross. 
As we remember the sacrifice of Jesus this Remembrance Sunday, we are also called to walk in forgiveness and love for our enemies and neighbors.

22:47 - Introduction to the readings
27:17 - 28:21 - Readings: Psalm 145. 1 – 10 NIVUK read by Elsje Hatton
28:42 - 31:25 - Hebrews 11. 1 – 10, 12. 1 – 3 NIVUK read by Tony Hatton

31:46 - 34:38 - Hymn TP 13 - Be still for the presence of the Lord

34:48 - 35:28 - Short prayer
35:31 - 46:54 - Short Address: ‘Keep going!’
We live in an age of information overload from social media and news.
The information cloud often contains disturbing news that leaves us feeling battered.
Global tragedies become local when they affect our families and neighbors.
We need stillness and community support to ask where faith fits in.
Faith is lived out through people's lives down the centuries.
Bible heroes like Noah and Moses held onto faith in hard times.
We are part of the story of faith when we rely on God's unseen reality.
The cloud of witnesses encourages us in our current challenges.
Keep focused on Jesus, throw off hindrances, and persevere.
In communion we connect with the faithful worldwide and through time.
Keep going by eliminating whatever trips us up spiritually.
The passage from Hebrews about being surrounded by the great cloud of witnesses provides the image of keeping going, persevering by being encouraged by those who have run the race of faith before us.
Keep walking with Christ no matter what difficulties we face.

We can feel battered by disturbing news. Yet faith has been lived out through the centuries, as shown by biblical heroes who relied on God even in hard times. We are part of this story of faith when we trust God's unseen reality. A cloud of witnesses from the past and present encourage us. The sermon calls us to stay focused on Jesus, removing hindrances and persevering despite difficulties. In communion we connect with faithful people across the world and throughout history.

33:09 - Introduction to the readings
34:39 - 36:34 - Reading Leviticus 19. 1,2, 9 – 18 NIVUK read by Sue Thorne
36:40 - 39:02 - Reading Matthew 22:34-46 (Good News) read by John Hillson

39:46 - 42:18 - Hymn - R&amp;S 745 A new commandment I give to you

42:23 - 59:19 - Address: ‘Love and justice’
Focus on the command to love God and neighbor from Leviticus.
Jesus deepened this command in 4 key ways.
  Jesus linked the command to love your neighbor as yourself with the command to love God with all your heart, soul, and mind. He saw them as two parts of the greatest commandment.
  Expanding &quot;neighbor&quot; to include all people, challenging tribalism. Jesus taught that &quot;neighbor&quot; includes those outside your own community, like the Good Samaritan helping a stranger.
  Demonstrating the depth of love through his life and death. Jesus showed what self-sacrificial, agape love looks like in his ministry, death on the cross, and resurrection.
  Giving the power to love through the Holy Spirit. At Pentecost, Jesus gave the gift of the Holy Spirit to empower his followers to love others as he loved them.
Love is practical - Leviticus gives examples.
Caring for vulnerable, pursuing justice - core themes.
Love and justice needed in conflicts like Israel Palestine.
Exploring Jesus' radical expanding of the command from Leviticus to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Jesus linked loving God fully with loving all neighbors, demonstrated self-sacrificial love, and gave the power of the Spirit to love. Leviticus shows love is practical - caring for vulnerable, pursuing justice. We're called to follow Jesus' example and love all, even enemies, challenging tribalism with God's overflowing love.

01:00:28 - 01:03:58 - Hymn R&amp;S 108 The love of God is broad

01:04:01 - 01:11:06 - Prayers for the church and the world with the response
We thank you for your great love and compassion:
help us to show that love today.

01:11:25 - 01:14:55 - Hymn - R&amp;S 95 God is love

01:14:56 - 01:15:29 - Blessing

38:41 - 01:00:34 - Sermon &quot;It is I; don't be afraid&quot;
followed by a time of quiet reflection
Jesus walks on water to meet the disciples in the storm. This shows his power over nature and the elements.
The story links to the Old Testament accounts of God's deliverance, exceeding Moses. It reveals Jesus' divine identity.
The disciples were obeying Jesus by going across the lake, yet still faced difficulty. Obeying God doesn't prevent troubles.
Jesus reassured the frightened disciples in the storm. He comes alongside us in our difficulties too.
Fear caused the disciples to panic and be influenced by superstition. We must not let fear and imagination misguide us.
Jesus said &quot;It is I, do not be afraid&quot; - echoing God's divine name. His words bring comfort.
To reach safety, the disciples had to invite Jesus into the boat. We need to let Jesus in our lives and trust Him.
Though believers face storms, Jesus offers security. He walked toward the disciples to help them.
The way out of hardship is to let go of fear, respond in faith, and let Jesus lead. He will never let us down.
Jesus gives forgiveness, new life and purpose. He goes with us each day, leading us eternally into God's presence.
This passage reveals Jesus' divine power and identity. Though followers face difficulties, Jesus offers comfort, security and purpose to those who trust Him. We must let go of fear, respond in faith, and let Him lead us through life's storms into the safety of God's presence.
A priest, a vicar and a Baptist minister go fishing together. The priest walks on the water to retrieve something he forgot, then comes back. Later, the vicar does the same. When the Baptist minister tries, he falls into the water. The priest asks the vicar if they should tell the Baptist minister where the stones are that they walked on.

26:57 - 29:44 - HYMN 517 As the bride is to her chosen
[Tune: Bridegroom]

29:50 - 43:02 - Address - Wisdom and generosity.
The readings are from Proverbs and Mark's Gospel about wisdom and generosity in daily life.
These themes are universal and apply to all humanity.
Proverbs was written to help Jews returning from exile reapply God's teachings.
Proverbs encourages following the Ten Commandments, trusting God, and turning from evil.
Wisdom is praised as more valuable than material riches.
In Mark's Gospel, Jesus meets a rich young man interested in following him.
Jesus tells the man to sell possessions and give the money to the poor.
The man is grieved because he can't let go of his possessions.
We who are rich must be generous and care for others.
Here is a paragraph for sermon notes:

The universal themes of wisdom and generosity from ancient Jewish texts apply to us today. Though wealthy, we must use wisdom in following God's laws and practice generosity through charity. We should care for others, especially the poor and those with challenges. This sermon calls us to examine our priorities and attachments that may limit generosity. Will we, like the rich young man, cling to possessions? Or will we joyfully share our riches with compassion?

Proverbs contains wise sayings, some dating back before 900 BC to King Solomon's time.
The later reflective passages in Proverbs were written around 520 BC when the Temple was rebuilt in Jerusalem after the Jews returned from exile in Babylon.
These passages were meant to help the returning Jews remember and reapply God's teachings and the Ten Commandments after being away for two generations.
Mark's Gospel was written around 30 years after Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection.
The story takes place around 25 AD as Jesus travels from Caesarea Philippi to Capernaum with his disciples.
Jesus had ministry in the Holy Land, also known as Israel/Palestine, the area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
The Jews had been absent from the Holy Land for about 450 years until the exodus from Egypt led by Moses.
This sermon connects the ancient wisdom from Proverbs to Jesus' teachings, showing continuity in Jewish thought across different historical periods.

10:11 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

10:26 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)
Thinking of events in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine

12:08 - Short time of quiet to prepare for worship

12:50 - Call to worship (Psalm 19. 7 – 9)
The law of the LORD is perfect, refreshing the soul.
The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the
simple.   The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the
heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to
the eyes.   The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring for ever.
The decrees of the LORD are firm, and all of them are righteous.

13:32 - 16:07 - Hymn R&amp;S 405 Angel voices ever singing

16:10 - 18:18 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

19:32 - 22:00 - Reading: Matthew 21. 33 - 46 read by Arthur Winning

22:11 - 27:20 - Reading  Isaiah 5 followed by an introduction to the service

Introduction to the service (All age talk)
Living down the road in a nice little flat with a lovely garden.
What would one do if they won the lottery.
A gardener for their current home.
Admiring a neighbor's well-kept garden.
Gardeners can feel kinship with God depicted as a gardener.
The passage describes God as a gardener cultivating a vineyard.
Imagine God as a divine gardener nurturing a vineyard, desiring good fruits of justice and righteousness. 
What fruits of faith God hopes to find in the church and world today.

27:33 - 30:24 - Hymn R&amp;S 277 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and we
share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and also with you) or
there are activities at the back of church.

31:16 - 33:32 - Reading: Philippians 3. 4b - 14 read by Norma Garden

33:48 - 37:24 - Hymn - R&amp;S 267 Immortal Love for ever full

37:33 - Address
Should Jesus be called meek and mild or provocative and disruptive?
Challenging the childhood prayer depicting Jesus as &quot;meek and mild.&quot;
Jesus shows aggression in the temple, overturning tables and disrupting commerce.
Jesus also shows kindness in healing the blind and lame.
Jesus curses the unfruitful fig tree, showing no mildness.
Jesus provokes and needles the Pharisees with parables.
The parable depicts the Pharisees as corrupt tenants who murder the landowner's son.
The Pharisees show no mercy in saying the tenants will meet a wretched end.
Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone the builders rejected.
Jesus threatens to take the kingdom from those not producing fruit.
The speaker challenges listeners to see their own reflection in the parable.

In this sermon, we upend the notion of a meek and mild Jesus. Looking at Jesus's aggression in the temple, provocation of the Pharisees, and imagery as a destructive stone, we see a disruptive and wild Jesus who challenges hypocrisy and corruption. 
How do we use power and produce fruit in our own lives? 
May this parable disrupt our assumptions and lead us to greater faithfulness.

02:45 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (Duty Elder)

05:30 - Call to worship (from the Iona Community)
The world belongs to God,
the earth and all its creatures.
How good it is, how wonderful,
to live together in unity.
Love and faith come together,
justice and peace join hands.
Open our lips, Great God,
and our mouths shall proclaim your praise.

06:07 - Hymn - R&amp;S 117 O Lord my God

10:20 - 12:26 - Opening Prayers

12:34 - 26:44 - All age Talk: ‘Season of Creation draws to a close’
The Season of Creation ended on October 4th and focused on justice, peace and caring for the planet.
Walking the river Wye and a fundraising walk.
Extreme flooding is increasing globally due to climate change.
The Thames flood barrier is having to be used more frequently to protect London.
Pacific island churches are threatened by rising seas and pleading for help protecting creation.
A church in Tuvalu may need to evacuate due to the threat of disappearing under rising seas.
There was good and bad news during the Season of Creation, including tree vandalism but also statements from church leaders.
The Prime Minister's remarks about delaying net zero targets caused concern.

Baptist and Methodist leaders issued a joint statement calling for urgent climate action and justice.
The message was to hold politicians accountable and let justice and peace flow like a river.
In summary, the church talk reflected on the Season of Creation and the urgent need for climate justice, highlighting flooding threats, calls from Pacific churches for action, dissent over the UK Prime Minister's climate policies, and a joint Christian leader statement demanding rapid, fair transitions to net zero emissions. We need to hold politicians accountable to bring justice and peace in caring for the threatened planet.


22:34 - A Video: ‘Prince Ea’s Challenge to humanity’ and a Prayer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-nEYsyRlYo

28:29 - Song - MP 1259 Bless the Lord, o my soul

33:12 - 34:46 - Reading: Psalm 25. 1 – 9 NIVUK read by Jeany Bien
34:57 - 37:45 - Matthew 21.23 – 32 NIVUK read by Harri Nola

38:20 - Hymn R&amp;S 493 Dear Master in whose life I see

40:04 - 55:04 - Short Address
Jesus asked many probing questions in the gospels - over 300! Questions can challenge us spiritually.
The religious leaders questioned Jesus' authority aggressively to undermine him.
Jesus cleverly evaded their trap by asking about John the Baptist's authority.
We must decide if Jesus had divine or merely human authority.
Accepting Jesus' authority shapes our lives around his power and vision.
Jesus' authority is central to the church's existence and mission.
With Jesus as Lord, we are called to act, not just express good intentions.
The parable challenges us - are we doing Jesus' work, even if we said yes to him?
People outside the church may live more Christlike lives through action.
We must turn faith into loving action in the world.
Our faith only has meaning if it flowers into purposeful action for justice and care in Jesus' name.

52:30 - 55:04 - A Prayer for the world and the church

55:30 - Welcome of David Bishop into church membership by reaffirmation:

59:34 - 01:03:22 - Hymn R&amp;S 107 The love of God comes close

01:03:22 - Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at
church (or at home) united in the name of Christ.

06:58 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able),

07:10 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

Short time of quiet to prepare for worship

10:20 - Call to worship
Jesus said, ‘Whoever drinks the water I give them will never
thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a
spring of water welling up to eternal life.’ John 4:14

10:50 - 13:36 - HYMN R&amp;S 689 As pants the hart

13:58 - 17:15 - Opening Prayer and the Lord’s Prayer

17:42 - 24:07 - Story: ‘Tiddalik the Greedy Frog’
The story of Tidlic the frog teaches us about greed and unfair distribution of resources.
On Rivers Sunday, we think about how water is not distributed fairly around the world.
Some of us waste water without thinking, while others lack access to clean water.
We have a responsibility to care for others, not just ourselves.
The story shows how Tidlic was greedy and hoarded all the water.
The animals tried to persuade Tidlic to share but he refused.
Laughter, not threats or anger, finally made Tidlic give back the water.
We should think about how best to persuade others - laughter over scare tactics.
The story is a metaphor - some hoard resources while others lack.
Our faith calls us to share earth's resources more fairly and sustainably.

24:13 - 27:09 - Hymn - MP 554 Peace is flowing like a river

27:56 - 31:22 - Bible Readings:
27:56 - 30:05 - Psalm 104. 5 – 13 NIVUK read by Abigail Lokko
30:25 - 31:22 - Revelation 22. 1 – 5 NIVUK read by Kitty Bird

32:21 - 35:38 - Hymn R&amp;S 340 I have no bucket, and the well is deep

35:47 - 48:30 - Sermon and time of quiet
Rivers run through the whole Bible and represent life, healing, justice and God's blessing.
We love rivers and need them, but have neglected and damaged them through greed and thoughtlessness.
The unfair distribution of water hurts the poor and vulnerable most severely.
Rich nations like ours have contributed most to climate change and river damage, while poorer nations suffer more.
We must care for rivers and share water resources more justly, as God desires.
Our baptism motivates us to care for creation and protect rivers.
We must experience God's living water spiritually, and let it flow out in justice.
This church's eco activities are a great witness - continue and do more.
We must tell politicians that climate change matters to us - take action.
Nourished by God's grace and healing water, we can help justice flow like a river.

35:44 - 37:29 - Hymn - All across the world (Tune R&amp;S 495)

1. All across the world there’s harvests 
gath’ring food we’re glad to eat; 
though we’ll never meet the farmers, 
keep us thankful for their feat. 

2. Foodstuffs gathered, packed and processed,
shipped and trucked and sold and bought; 
for all people who supply us, 
may we show the thanks we ought. 

3. Where rewards divide unjustly,
workers struggle to survive,
may we act to make trade fairer,
play our part, keep hope alive. 

4. God who cares for all who harvest,
God who cares for all who eat, 
keep us thankful, keep us acting 
’til your justice is complete. 

© 2016 Kevin Mayhew John Campbell 

38:03 - 39:48 - Reading: 2 Corinthians 9:6-15  NIVUK  - read by Valerie and David 

39:54 - 47:51 - Short Talk; 'sow generously'
Gratitude: An expression of thanks to God for His indescribable gift.
Generosity: The importance of generosity, highlighting that all good things come from the generous love and grace of God.
The metaphor of a seed, emphasizing how a seed must be sown, die in the ground, and then produce an incredible harvest.
Jesus' fascination with seeds and how He used parables like the sower and the seed to convey important lessons.
Seeds are described as fascinating because they contain life within a tiny shell and, under the right conditions, can produce something marvelous.
Paul's challenge to a vibrant but sometimes divided Corinthian church.
Giving Cheerfully: Paul encourages cheerful giving and emphasizes that it should be a personal decision rather than driven by guilt or comparison with others.
Multiplication of Seeds: How a single seed of Jesus' life has multiplied into millions or billions of changed lives over centuries.
An example of a simple act of generosity, starting with a small cupboard in Saint Andrews Church, which has grown to help hundreds of thousands of people in need.
The Abundance of God's Love: The immense, indescribable gift of God's love and grace, freely given, and encourages generosity in response.
All good things come from God's abundant love and grace
Generosity is a reflection of God's love and a means to bring blessings to others, creating a harvest of joy and love.

  Where can I go from your spirit?
  Or where can I flee from your presence?
  If I ascend to heaven, you are there;

  If I take the wings of the morning and settle at the farthest limits of the sea,
  even there your hand shall lead me,
  and your right hand shall hold me fast

28:03 - 41:52 - Sermon
Jacob was a lonely, guilty figure fleeing his past when he had the dream.
God had to speak to Jacob in a dream when he was passive to get through to him.
In the dream, Jacob saw a ladder between heaven and earth with angels going up and down.
The passage points to Jesus as the ladder between heaven and earth.
Jesus referred to himself as the ladder between heaven and earth.
The passage also tells us something about the church as a &quot;trusting&quot; place where heaven and earth meet.
The church is a special meeting place between God and people.
The passage addresses us individually in our own lonely, guilty, or dark places.
Even when we don't know it, God can be present with us in those painful places.
Those painful places can later become &quot;Bethel&quot; - the house of God.
