09:45 - Call to Worship - Psalm 22. 27 -31

14:36 - Opening Prayers and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer

17:49 - 19:18 - Reading: John 15. 1 ‚Äì 8 read by Sue Thorne

19:26 - 23:22 - Introduction to the service (All age talk)
Not being much of a gardener and finding it a waste of time
An exception was a small plant grown from a single leaf given out at an Easter Sunday service a few years ago.
The leaf was told to be planted upside down in potting compost, and surprisingly it took root and grew into a sizable plant.
This plant taught the lesson that we need to be part of something - specifically, attached to Jesus who is the true vine.
Jesus provides the life-giving energy and sustenance for us to bear good fruit and do his work.
If we take this seriously and do the work Jesus desires, our spiritual fruit would multiply and increase our impact.
Jesus said he is the true vine, and God the Father is the gardener who prunes the branches.
Branches must remain attached to the vine (Jesus) to receive the life-giving sap and produce fruit.
To bear the fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, etc., we must stay connected to Jesus as our source.
It is important to stay in touch with Jesus every single day of our lives to receive his life in us.

23:32 - 26:34 - Hymn R&amp;S 234 Alleluia, alleluia, give thanks

27:10 - 30:40 - Reading: Acts 8. 26 ‚Äì 40 read by John Hillson

30:59 - 34:01 - Hymn R&amp;S 71 O God of Bethel, by whose hand

34:32 - 46:06 - Address
Two important words to consider today - inclusivity and diversity
Policies and actions need to be evaluated for promoting inclusivity and diversity for all people regardless of gender, family situation, disability, lifestyle, or racial background.
The Gospel story challenges us to consider the radical inclusivity and diversity of God's love revealed in Jesus.
The Ethiopian eunuch was a powerful court official who was physically impotent/castrated, likely non-Jewish and from the ancient kingdom of Kush.
He was reading Isaiah's suffering servant prophecies about Jesus, but was excluded from the Jerusalem temple as a eunuch.
Yet Isaiah promises inclusion for foreigners and eunuchs who keep God's covenant.
This prefigures the church's expansion from Jewish followers of Jesus to the whole world.
The eunuch, excluded from societal binaries, may have been nearer to God and invited Philip to join him.
Like Philip, the church needs to be open to meeting people on their territory, not just inviting them into church buildings.

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00 - Music before the service

Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able), 

02:11 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

03:48 - Call to worship (1 Peter 1.3)

04:13 - 07:54 - Hymn - God is love

08:03 - Prayer of adoration and confession 
The Lord‚Äôs Prayer (traditional words)

10:07 - 19:55 - Introduction for all ages: ‚ÄòPassing on the message‚Äô

20:17 - 21:42 - Reading: 1 Corinthians 15. 1 ‚Äì 10 read by Sarah

23:21 - Affirmation:
Christ died   for our sins.

Thank you Jesus  Thank you Lord.

24:29 - Hymns - All heaven declares, Jesus, hope of the nations

30:15 - Introducing second reading 

32:09 - 33:39 - Reading: 1 Corinthians 15. 12 ‚Äì 20 read by Norma

33:52 - 41:47 - Talk: ‚ÄòChrist‚Äôs risen life and ours‚Äô

42:07 - 45:08 - Hymn - Jesus lives!

45:39 - 49:08 - Reading: 1 Corinthians 15.35 ‚Äì 45, 51 ‚Äì 58 
read by Sarah and Norma

49:16 - 56:10 - Talk - ‚Äòunfolding a mystery‚Äô
The passage (1 Corinthians 15) begins and ends with questions about resurrection and the defeat of death.
Paul delights in the diversity and splendor of the natural world.
Resurrection is not about endless, indefinite life extension, but transformation into a new, imperishable existence.
What is perishable, dishonorable, weak, and natural will be raised imperishable, glorious, powerful, and spiritual - a mystery beyond our imagination.
Death is a fundamental reality of human existence, but not the final reality; God revealed in the risen Christ is the final reality.
We are all diminished by each person's death, but connected through the risen Jesus who brings hope.
John Donne's poem depicting death as temporary: &quot;one short sleep past, we wake eternally.&quot;
Drawing from Isaiah, Paul declares death is &quot;swallowed up in victory&quot; through Christ's resurrection.
The &quot;sting&quot; of death is sin, but God gives ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.
Our labor for God's kingdom is not in vain, bearing fruit in this life and beyond, when we live in hope, faith, and eternal love.

56:30 - 59:10 - Hymn Now the green blade rises

59:14 - 01:04:36 - Prayers of thanksgiving and intercession with the response
Lord of all life: hear our prayer. 

01:04:52 - 01:07:33 - Hymn - R&amp;S 260  Christ is alive! 

01:07:34 - 01:08:06 - Blessing

01:08:33 - 01:12:40 - Music after the service

28:39 - 30:14 - 2nd Reading: Acts 3. 12 ‚Äì 19 read by Ian Bogart

30:41 - 34:18 - Hymn R&amp;amp;S 373: Lord Jesus Christ, you have come to us

34:25 - 52:17 - Address - followed by time of quiet reflection
The apparent doubt experienced by the disciples when Jesus appeared to them after his resurrection.
The disciples' doubt is encouraging, as it shows that it's okay to have doubts in one's faith.
The external context and events that can bring doubts into people's minds, but God is not responsible for these.
The core message of the Gospel, which is that Jesus died so that people can repent and be forgiven.
The concept of being &quot;justified&quot; by Christ's death on the cross, meaning that one is seen as if they had never sinned.
The message of repentance and forgiveness of sins is central to the Gospel, as seen in the passages from Luke and Acts.
What would we have done if Jesus had lived among us - people can sometimes be carried away by the crowd.
Regardless of past actions, people can be forgiven by God if they truly repent.
The commission Jesus gave to his disciples, which is to share the good news and encourage people to repent and be forgiven.
Allow the Holy Spirit to open their minds to the scriptures and empower them to share the Gospel message.

16:50 - 17:35 - Reading: John 12. 12 -16 NIVUK read by Linda


17:48 - 20:51 - Introduction to the service (All age talk)
Jesus' welcome into Jerusalem
Jesus received a triumphant welcome into Jerusalem, with people waving palm branches and shouting &quot;Hosanna!&quot;
The crowd welcomed Jesus as the new King, expecting him to overthrow the Romans and establish God's kingdom.
We can be like that crowd, getting excited about Jesus and promising to work for his kingdom.
We pray, worship, give, and strive to live loving and honest lives in service to God's will.
Yet the same crowd that praised Jesus also turned on him, shouting &quot;Crucify him!&quot;
There are times when we similarly reject Jesus' way of love, humility, and obedience.
In those moments, we join the crowd calling for Jesus' crucifixion.
We struggle to fully embrace the demands of God's kingdom when it conflicts with our desires.
The call is to consistently live &quot;Hosanna!&quot; with our lives, not rejecting Christ's lordship.
We must continually realign our hearts to receive Jesus as King, not just in celebratory moments.

27:17 - 31:20 - Hymn As Royal banners are unfurled
(Tune Gonfalon Royal)

31:56 - 45:32 - Address - From Palms to Passion: A Holy Week Journey
We are called to embrace the solemn and reflective nature of Lent as a season of repentance and preparation.
We witness the climax of the passion narrative during Holy Week, accompanying Jesus from his triumphal entry to his crucifixion and resurrection.
we recognize the extravagant act of the woman who anointed Jesus with expensive perfume as a beautiful expression of devotion.
We are challenged to move beyond the &quot;market mind&quot; that sees such acts as wasteful, and instead appreciate the spiritual value.
We are invited to lift your worship and service to the level of beauty, going beyond the minimum with unsolicited gifts of love.
We are encouraged to do what you can, even if it seems unexciting or unspectacular, as that is often the highest achievement.
We are reminded that true discipleship involves transforming duty into the maximum of beauty through the &quot;fine excess&quot; of imagination and love.
We are called to echo the hosannas that proclaimed Jesus as the long-awaited King during his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
We are urged to accompany Jesus on his journey from Palm Sunday to Easter, immersing yourselves in the profound liturgies and symbolism.
We are exhorted to live out the self-giving, unmeasured generosity exemplified by the woman who anointed Jesus.

For God‚Äôs love endures for ever

28:10 - Prayer and Lord‚Äôs Prayer

29:21 - Introducing the reading

30:20 - 31:00 - Reading John 12:20-22 NIVUK read by Nathanael Bello
20¬† Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to
worship at the festival.¬† 21¬† They came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. ‚ÄòSir,‚Äô they said, ‚Äòwe would like to
see Jesus.‚Äô¬† 22¬† Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn
told Jesus.

31:11 - 37:47 - Talk: ‚ÄòWanting to see‚Äô

Question 1: How do we help people to ‚Äòsee‚Äô Jesus?
38:11 - Prayers with Song TP 74 Open our eyes we want to see Jesus (x 2)

40:04 - Seeing Jesus in each other ‚Äì coffee served at the tables

53:02 - 54:50 - Reading John 12:22-33 read by Harri Bello
23¬† Jesus replied,¬†‚ÄòThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be
glorified.¬† 24¬† Very truly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the
ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it
produces many seeds.¬† 25¬† Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while
anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal
life.¬† 26¬† Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my
servant also will be. My Father will honour the one who serves me.
27¬† ‚ÄòNow my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‚ÄúFather,
save me from this hour‚Äù? No, it was for this very reason I came to
this hour.¬† 28¬† Father, glorify your name!‚Äô
Then a voice came from heaven, ‚ÄòI have glorified it, and will
glorify it again.‚Äô¬† 29¬† The crowd that was there and heard it said it had
thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
30¬† Jesus said,¬†‚ÄòThis voice was for your benefit, not mine.¬† 31¬† Now is the
time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be
driven out.¬† 32¬† And I, when I am lifted up¬†from the earth, will draw all
people to myself.‚Äô¬† 33¬† He said this to show the kind of death he was
going to die.

55:57 - Question 2: What does this reading tell us about the death
of Jesus?

56:07 - 01:00:52 - Talk: ‚Äòthe One and the many‚Äô

01:01:22 - 01:02:53 - Reading: ‚ÄòOne Solitary Life‚Äô

Song R&amp;S 375 In my life Lord be glorified

01:10:47 - Activity at tables ‚Äì sow a seed
Spend a few moments quietly thinking about how the seed
must ‚Äòdie‚Äô (split open and shrivel up) in order for new
growth to come. 

Then we offer this prayer:
01:21:50 - Lord, you have sown the seed of your love in our hearts.
May we welcome and nurture your love.
Calm our fears and make our prejudices fade away and
die.
May we welcome and nurture your love.
Help us to open our hearts and our arms to others.
May we welcome and nurture your love.
Loving Lord, keep us in your love.
May we welcome and nurture your love,
now and for ever. Amen.

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00:00 - Music before the service

11:54 - Hymn MP 454 Majesty, worship his majesty¬†

14:34 - Hymn MP 1076 Jesus be the centre

16:57 - Opening Prayers and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer

19:54 - 24:22 - All age talk: ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs day‚Äù
We've all got mothers, even if we don't have them anymore. 
Empathy is understanding what someone is going through. As mothers, you also multitask, are flexible when plans change, nurse injured children, and more.
We try to remind those mothers that they have gifts they don't realize - organization, timekeeping, cooking, cleaning - a mother is special.
Maybe some of you didn't have such an easy mother. Some feel neglected. But a mother's job is so difficult.
We thank God for the gifts to be good parents and grandparents, for the teachings to guide and empower us.
Today, let's pray for struggling mothers - financial issues, difficult relationships or single parents.


24:25 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:
Adults: May the Lord be with you
Junior Church: And also with you
All: Amen

25:01 - 27:11 - Old Testament Reading: Psalm 145 

28:50 - 23:27 - Hymn. MP 1350 Speak o Lord

33:10 - 34:42 - New Testament Reading: 2 Peter 1: 1 ‚Äì 11

34:50 - 58:42 - Sermon ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Divine Power and His Precious Promises&quot; 
Do you to know God's abundant grace and peace through truly knowing Him, not just biblical knowledge. Do you regularly talk to Him and give Him your problems?
God says He has given you everything you need for life and godliness through His divine power. Do you believe that, even for areas you struggle with?
When you became a Christian, God's Holy Spirit came to live in you, giving you access to all God's power and resources. Do you realize what that means?
Don't just try to change in your own strength. Give your problems fully to God, and let His Spirit empower you. I had to do that for worrying.
For even small decisions, ask God which way He wants you to go. He may have purposes you don't realize by choosing one way over another.
God has given us very great and precious promises to participate in His divine nature. Read and claim His promises for your life.
Make every effort to add virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, kindness and love to the faith God gave you.
If you lack these, you become ineffective and unproductive, forgetting you've been cleansed from sin. Don't let that happen!
Therefore, confirm your calling. If you cultivate these qualities, you'll never stumble and receive a rich welcome into Christ's eternal Kingdom.

A time of quiet reflection

58:59 - 01:03:01- Hymn. R&amp;S 92 Amazing Grace‚Äù

01:03:21 - 01:07:07 - Prayers for others and ourselves
We pray for those places in strife - Israel and Palestine, Russia and Ukraine, Yemen, many places in Africa, the Middle East.

01:07:42 - 01:11:12 - Hymn. R&amp;S 489 Be thou my vision‚Äù

01:13:37 - 01:14:04 - Closing blessing.

01:14:34 - 01:20:28 - Music after the service

00:00:00 - Music before the service

04:29 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

04:59 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

06:25 - Call to worship: taken from Mark 8:34

07:15 - Hymn: R&amp;S 107 The love of God comes close, tune: Rhosymedre

11:31 - Opening prayers of Approach, Confession &amp;amp; Thanksgiving

16:55 - The Lord‚Äôs Prayer (modern version)

WE LISTEN FOR GOD‚ÄôS WORD
17:38 - 20:49 - Reading: Mark 8:31-38 read by John Hillson

20:54 - 26:22 - All Age Talk: Seek the cross and gain life?
Live Origami in church (#firsttime, #newtrick)
It's a risky trick with no safety net
The trick will help understand the Gospel reading about finding fullness of life
Folding the paper to represent different aspects of life - mountain, house, airplane 
The airplane represents jetting off and enjoying life
The tricky part is cutting the paper in half down the middle
Unfolding the paper reveals a cross shape - picking up your cross
Arranging the cross pieces spells out &quot;life&quot;
Following the way of the cross leads to fullness of life
The minister's friend Paul Robinson suggested the trick


26:52 - Hymn: R&amp;S 522 From heaven you came (The Servant King)

31:07 - Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and
we share a blessing ‚Äì the Lord be with you; and also with
you: Amen,) or there are activities at the back of church.

31:30 - 34:29 - Reading: Mark 14:53-54, 66-72 read by Jeany Bien

34:54 - 37:32 - Hymn: R&amp;S 355 Jesus calls us! O‚Äôer the tumult, tune: Cross of
Jesus

37:37 - 48:03 - Sermon: Take up your cross
The gospel reading is emotional, vivid, and terrifying for the disciples
We should try to put ourselves in the disciples' shoes and feel their fear
This was the first time Jesus told them he would die and rise again
The disciples likely shut down and didn't comprehend or believe Jesus
Peter denies Jesus will die, and Jesus rebukes him harshly
Jesus challenges the Jewish authorities' corruption and collusion with Rome 
Jesus asks the disciples to &quot;pick up their cross&quot; - shocking language about a painful death 
Jesus does not promise an easy life - it will involve suffering
We may not be called to Jesus' level of suffering, but our cross will still be difficult
Like Peter, we may fail to embrace the cross, but will have repeated chances to try again 

WE MAKE OUR RESPONSE

48:30 - 51:29 - Hymn: Trinity Praise 13 ‚Äì Be Still, for the presence of the
Lord

51:33 - Dedication of the Offertory

52:13 - 57:07 - Prayers of Intercession

57:37 - 01:02:25 - Hymn: R&amp;S 530 Living God, your joyful Spirit, tune: Abbots Leigh

01:02:27 - 01:02:50 - Closing blessing

01:03:12 - 01:05:57 - Music after the service

14:32 - 20:44 - Opening Prayers and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer

21:24 - 24:39 - Reading: Isaiah 58: 1 ‚Äì 12 read by Norma Garden

Hymn: R&amp;S 123 Think of a world

39:04 - 57:10 -  Address: followed by time of quiet reflection
The story discusses an abandoned lighthouse that was converted by a local artist into a climbing center for youth, shining a symbolic light when they reach the top, as well as a Methodist church that wants to serve its struggling community by offering its building to help distribute secondhand children's clothing and &quot;shine a light&quot; by helping people live better lives even if they don't attend church.
The lighthouse was abandoned and there were unsuccessful plans to convert it into a museum, restaurant, or flats.
Tam McCarthy had a vision to convert it into a climbing center to help the local youth.
Tam was a local artist who became successful and gave back to the community.
The climbing center at the lighthouse became very popular and successful.
The light at the top of the lighthouse is lit when someone reaches the top, symbolizing their achievement.
Many local Methodist churches have closed down and they want to keep their church open.
They want to use their building to serve the community even if people don't attend church.
An example is allowing a group to distribute secondhand children's clothing from the church.
Church activities don't have to directly involve the church, the goal is to help the community.
They hope to metaphorically &quot;shine a light&quot; and help people live better lives even if they don't attend church.

57:40 - 59:25 - Hymn: R&amp;S 412 There‚Äôs a quiet understanding

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00:00 - Music before the service

07:19 - Entry of the bible

07:39 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

10:47 - Call to worship: verses from Psalm 50 
The mighty one, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
Our God comes and does not keep silent; 
before him  is a devouring fire and a mighty tempest all around him.
He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he  may judge his people:
‚ÄúGather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!‚Äù
The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. 

13:12 - Hymn: R&amp;S 373 Lord Jesus Christ, we have come to you

16:25 - Opening Prayers and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer

19:30 - 28:49 - Introduction to the theme
God's mystery and wonder, focusing on mountaintop experiences like Jesus' transfiguration.
Has anyone had any special experiences recently
Flowers from the garden like snowdrops that lift the heart after winter.
In the transfiguration story, Jesus took his closest disciples Peter, James and John up a mountain.
Jesus was transfigured, his clothes shining white, with Moses and Elijah appearing.
The disciples were terrified by this divine vision showing Jesus' glory.
God's voice affirms Jesus as his Son, saying to listen to him.
Like baptism and Jesus' birth, this is a rare moment where heaven meets earth.
The transfiguration comes as Jesus heads toward his death, affirming God's plan.
We should listen for God's wonder and mystery as we gather in faith.
Glimpses of God's divine wonder and mystery in mountaintop spiritual experiences like Jesus' transfiguration, where he was affirmed by Moses, Elijah and God's voice as the beloved Son, and similarly at his baptism and birth.

Readings:  
29:40 - 32:31 - 2 Kings 2:1-12 read by Sue
32:46 - 34:21 - Mark 9:2-9 read by Abigail

34:51 - 37:14 - Hymn:  R&amp;S 572 Colours of day dawn into the mind

37:49 - 01:00:23 - Address:  Christ revealed  - followed by time of quiet reflection 
The readings involve mystery and symbolism, raising questions rather than giving clear answers.
The story of Elijah and Elisha - Elisha asks to take on Elijah's spirit before Elijah is taken up to heaven.
The story foreshadows Elisha becoming the next prophet and inheriting a &quot;double portion&quot; of Elijah's spirit.
There are visions, miracles and God's power in the stories.
The Transfiguration shows Jesus' divine nature as well as his humanity.
We are all created in God's image and should reflect God's glory in our actions.
We can glimpse God's glory in ordinary things like nature, a baby being born, a friend's wisdom.
Lent is a time for pause, reflection and prayer as we approach Easter.
A smile each day in Lent can spread joy and reflect God's light in us.
We need feeding from God's light like solar panels need sunlight.

01:00:49 - 01:03:30 - Hymn: R&amp;S 67   Immortal, Invisible, God only wise (tune: Haresfield)

01:03:32 - 01:10:13 - Prayers of Intersession
 Response:   Lord in your mercy  Hear our prayer

01:10:23 - 01:13:34 - Hymn:  Christ triumphant

01:13:36 - 01:14:13 - Closing blessing 

01:14:36 - 01:19:24 - Music after the service

What makes people feel better when feeling down, with answers like music and chocolate.
Favorite hymns and films that lift their spirits when down.
What makes us feel better needs to be the right remedy for the situation.
One of the best ways to help people feel better is to care for them and show love.
Caring for yourself when a carer
TV and radio provide comfort but don't replace real company.
Jesus was very concerned for the weak and ill.
People were always looking for Jesus, but he would withdraw to pray and recharge.
These words can help discover the healing that comes through faith in God.
Things that can make people feel better when they are down, from music to care and company, noting that the remedy should fit the need.  
Jesus' practice of withdrawing from demanding crowds to pray and renew his spirit to serve others.

30:19 - 45:53 - Sermon: ‚ÄúA rich feast‚Äù followed by short time of silence
The Old Testament and Psalm readings portray God as great, caring for people in exile.
The gospel shows Jesus healing and taking time to pray and listen to God.
We can experience healing by knowing God loves and cares for us.
Paul says preaching the gospel is compelled by God, not something to boast about.
Working at the airport learning other ways to share faith.
Actions can preach, but words are still needed to share the hope within us.
Short conversations can lead to emotional healing by changing perspectives.
God still sustains the weak and powerless today through Jesus.

24:43 Hymn - R&amp;S 332 Jesus lover of my soul

29:10 - 38:38 - Address
Reflecting on school days and strict teachers like the headmaster who also served in church.
The Bible passage about Jesus' teaching makes us think about impactful teachers.
Jesus taught with authority unlike the rabbis who referenced earlier teachings.
Jesus was confident in his identity as God's Son which integrated his character and teaching.
We should also be ready to give account of our hope without just appealing to the past.
Jesus' words had immediate impact, like healing the man. His message was freedom.
Jesus walked the walk, not just talked. We should have integrating words and actions.
Jesus earned authority by freeing and helping people, not from any office.
We need to know our beloved identity in Christ through baptism and worship.
Our everyday words and actions should bring God's kingdom like Jesus did.
We are reminded to internalize our Christian identity so that our actions align with our words in bringing positive change, rather than relying solely on past teaching.

Links to a couple previously held hostage there that we prayed for. 
The importance of welcoming others, like Abraham and Sarah showing hospitality to angel visitors. Ways to welcome include providing refreshments and making people comfortable.

47:17 - Hymn - R&amp;S 309 Spirit of the Living God move among us

48:33 - 01:00:32 - Address - The Transforming Power of Love for Neighbour
The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us the meaning of loving our neighbor
The Good Samaritan went far beyond what was expected to care for the wounded stranger
We should not just pass by those in need but stop and truly help
Unity and reconciliation are needed in divided communities like Burkina Faso
Christians there are working together across denominations to help displaced people
We must have hope - &quot;the moment of reconciliation will come&quot;
The command to love God and neighbor matters more than religious laws and debates
We must move from seeing &quot;neighbor&quot; as a noun to becoming a neighbor through action
We can collaborate to be Good Samaritans addressing desperation in our own communities
Love never ends - it bears, believes, hopes and endures all things
Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan, focusing on the Samaritan's loving action towards the wounded stranger. This radical care for neighbor should inspire Christians today, even in divided communities, to work together in reconciliation and service.

of the Chemin Neuf Community)
Lord Jesus, who prayed that all might be one,
we pray to you for the unity of all Christians,
according to your will, according to your means.
May your Spirit enable us to experience
the suffering caused by division,
to see our sin and to hope beyond all hope. Amen.

01:11:58 - 01:14:02 - Hymn R&amp;S 647 In Christ there is no East or West

01:14:03 - 01:14:28 - Blessing
