12:18 - 14:17 - Hymn - R&amp;S 302 – O breath of life

14:39 - 16:09 - Reading: Psalm 104:24-34, 35b NIVUK
read by Lesley Bogart

24 How many are your works, LORD!
    In wisdom you made them all;
    the earth is full of your creatures.
25  There is the sea, vast and spacious,
    teeming with creatures beyond number –
    living things both large and small.
26  There the ships go to and fro,
    and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
27  All creatures look to you
    to give them their food at the proper time.
28  When you give it to them,
    they gather it up;
when you open your hand,
    they are satisfied with good things.
29  When you hide your face,

    they are terrified;
when you take away their breath,
    they die and return to the dust.
30  When you send your Spirit,
    they are created,
    and you renew the face of the ground.
31  May the glory of the LORD endure for ever;
    may the LORD rejoice in his works –
32  he who looks at the earth, and it trembles,
    who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
33  I will sing to the LORD all my life;
    I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
34  May my meditation be pleasing to him,
    as I rejoice in the LORD.
35b  Praise the LORD, my soul.
Praise the LORD.

20:27 - 23:18 - Hymn R&amp;S 310 – Gracious Spirit

23:23 - 30:12 - Talk for all ages - Looking forward to Pentecost?
Pentecost or Whit Sunday was a highly anticipated and cherished event 
The whole city of Sheffield, regardless of religious affiliation, looked forward to this occasion. 
The churches in different areas would come together, accompanied by uniformed groups and bands, to march in a procession towards the park for celebrations. 
The event included singing, pageantry, and the crowning of a queen. 
It was a significant and joyful gathering that brought people together to celebrate something meaningful to everyone involved. 
Reflecting on the nostalgia and the sense of community and togetherness that characterized the event


30:25 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:
Adults: May the Lord be with you
Junior Church: And also with you
All: Amen

31:00 - 34:20 - Reading: Acts 2: 1-21 NIVUK read by Ian Bogart

35:04 - 38:21 - Hymn R&amp;S 489 – Be Thou my vision

38:29 - 56:57 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection
&quot;Welcoming Each Wonder&quot; by Tom Gordon.
A boy named Nathan and his questions about God.
Nathan asks his grandmother about what God is like and how he can be present even though he can't be seen.
His grandmother uses the analogy of soap slipping out of one's hands to explain the presence of God.
Nathan realizes that God, like the soap, can disappear but always comes back.
The story highlights the idea that God is always there, even if we can't see Him, and we just know when He is present.
The work of Wycliffe Bible translators and the importance of translating the Bible into native languages.
The story encourages sharing our experience of God in a language that others can understand.
A reminder that the spirit of God is always speaking to us, even if we may not always be listening.

00:11 - 06:25 - All age Talk:  Forgiveness
The theme of the service is forgiveness and renewal.
Sharing their thoughts on forgiveness.
Forgiveness is explained as apologizing to someone after being rude and them forgiving you.
Examples of situations that require forgiveness are discussed, such as being hurt or having something damaged.
Forgiveness is acknowledged as a difficult process, both for individuals and for God.
The reading from Zechariah in the Old Testament illustrates God's forgiveness towards the Israelite people after their exile in Babylon.
The Lord's Prayer emphasises the importance of forgiving others as we ask for God's forgiveness.
Humans are not deserving of God's forgiveness, but God's mercy allows for forgiveness when we recognize our mistakes and are truly sorry.
The challenge of genuinely being sorry when seeking forgiveness.
The significance of forgiveness in the service's theme of forgiveness and renewal.

17:00 - 18:51 - Hymn - In Christ there is no east or west
[Tune: St Bernard] 

18:57 - 33:44 - Sermon
The prophet Zechariah, along with Ezra and Nehemiah, facilitated the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple after the Jews' return from Exile in Babylon.
The temple rebuilding was delayed due to local politics and opposition from the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Persian king Atasurpses.
After 20 years, the people were reminded of their identity as God's chosen people and were motivated to rebuild the temple.
The prophet Zechariah announces God's word and emphasizes the urgency for action and restoration.
God promises to restore safety and good fortune to the people of Jerusalem, bringing peace and blessings.
Despite ongoing challenges and injustices in the world, God remains present and offers salvation through Jesus Christ.
The Book of Revelation, written by John, provides encouragement to the persecuted Christians and reassurance of God's ultimate purpose.
Accepting the Water of Life offered by Jesus symbolizes spiritual sustenance and eternal life.
The teachings from these ancient texts remind us of the unchanging nature of human beings, God's faithfulness, and the opportunity for personal restoration and renewal through forgiveness and faith.
The world is characterized by difficulties, inequalities, injustices, and the actions of bossy, greedy individuals who cause harm to others.
Through embracing the teachings and life of Jesus Christ, individuals can experience personal restoration, renewal, and have their names written in the book of the Lamb.

36:26 - HYMN R&amp;S 264 He is Life (vs 3 and 4) sung seated

37:54 - 46:53 - Short Address
Different people in the church have varying reactions to the coronation ceremony.
Some appreciate the colorful uniforms, vestments, and rituals, while others prefer something simpler.
There is a mix of emotions, including discomfort when the ritual becomes disconnected from Jesus on the cross.
King Charles, like any human being, experienced nervousness and anxiety during the anointing.
The greater truth of the ceremony is that Jesus is exalted above all, and every knee should bow to him.
The readings draw us into the wonder of who Jesus is and how he brings us to the Divine reality.
&quot;God Save the King&quot; reminds us that we all need saving, and God has a part to play in our nation.
King Charles has a representative role that goes beyond politics and arguments.
The speaker hopes that King Charles will preserve the nation's laws and diversity.
The letter of Peter reminds us to draw spiritual sustenance from God's love.
The sharing of the Lord's Supper reminds us that we all need sustenance and to draw close to God.

09:13 - Entry of the Bible  

09:17 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle

10:45 - Call to worship
Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth.
Worship the LORD with gladness;
Come before God with joyful songs.
Know that the LORD is God.
It is God who made us, and we are his; ;
we are God’s people, the sheep of his pasture.
Enter God’s gates with thanksgiving
and his courts with praise;
Give thanks to God and praise his name.
God’s love endures forever.

11:31 - 13:15 - Hymn - I will enter his gates (sung twice)

13:23 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

15:46 - 24:54 - Introduction for all ages: ‘Recognise that voice?’
Missing Easter at Trinity due to scheduling conflicts.
During Good Friday, the church had stations of prayer, including one titled &quot;The Buried Grain,&quot; where people were invited to plant a pinch of seed into a tray of soil.
This links to the Bible verse where Jesus compares his death to a buried grain that produces new life.
The speaker sees the growth of the planted seeds as a symbol of Jesus' love within us, reverberating down the centuries and producing fruit in the lives of billions of people.
The Bee Squared program (https://zeroch.org/bee-squared/) that encourages people to plant wildflowers to support bees and other insects crucial to life.
Jesus is referred to as the Good Shepherd and the gateway to God's loving presence.
Jesus' sheep recognize and trust his voice, and the speaker asks the audience to think of a voice they trust, like Mary Berry's recipe or Winston Churchill's wartime speeches.
There are many voices out there today, and the speaker urges the audience to choose which voices they trust.


Reading: John 10.1 – 10 NIVUK read by Kitty 

27:49 - Prayer
Lord you are the Way – help us to follow.
You are the truth – help us to listen.
You are the Life – refresh our lives today. Amen.

28:24 - 30:23 - Hymn - Jesus stand among us

30:44 - 31:33 - Reading: Psalm 23 NIVUK read by Kate 

31:41 - 39:44 - Meditation on the 23 rd Psalm – ‘being a follower of the Good
Shepherd’ (using Stuart Townend sung version MP 1008)
Sing verse 1
Leader: Let us think about how Jesus leads us in times past
and in the present time. (pause) Let us think about the life
Jesus offers us, life in abundance.
(pause, then sing the chorus)
Sing verse 2
Leader: Let us think about and receive again the inner peace
offered by Jesus. (pause) Let us think about and receive again
the contentment Jesus offers.
(pause, then sing the chorus)
Sing verse 3
Leader: Let us think about Jesus’ presence in difficult times
holding before him our troubles and concerns. (pause) Let us
think about drawing closer to Jesus and receiving his love and
protection from harm.
(pause, then sing the chorus)

40:21 - 41:26 - Reading: John 10.11 – 16 NIVUK read by Kitty

42:06 - 43:17 - Hymn The King of love vs 1 and 6 only -sung seated

43:54 - 56:30 - Address
The Great &quot;I ams&quot;
Jesus describes himself as &quot;I am&quot; seven times in John's Gospel.
Each description (&quot;I am the Good Shepherd,&quot; &quot;I am the bread of life,&quot; etc.) takes us into the heart of who Jesus is.
&quot;I am&quot; is not just a personal description but echoes God's words to Moses in the desert.
In John's Gospel, &quot;I am&quot; is linked to the fundamentals of life.
The Shepherd lies down in front of the entrance and protects the sheep through the night.
This intimate picture of the Shepherd is full of trust and care.
Jesus is the Good Shepherd who knows us through and through and wants to protect and keep us safe.
The Gate is the cross, where Jesus protects, leads, and opens up heaven and God's love to us.
Jesus is both the king of kings and the outcast, the one who is poor and rejected.


56:44 - 58:33 - Hymn- All heaven declares

58:41 - 01:05:55 - Prayers for the world with the response
God of truth and love,
bring them abundant life.

01:06:14 - 01:09:32 - Hymn - Christ is the King! O friends rejoice

01:09:33 - 01:09:58 - Closing blessing

How long ago did you last play hide and seek?
Jesus walking with the disciples, hidden in plain sight.
Jesus was not noticed by the disciples when he was walking with them.
We can sometimes be so focused on our own problems that we don't see the miracles or the ordinary everyday things that are right in front of us.
We should pray that God will open our eyes and our hearts to see him in ways that we don't expect.

We all make plans

It can be difficult to deal with unexpected events.
Faith in God can help us deal with unexpected events.
The story of the Road to Emmaus shows how Jesus can come alongside us in unexpected ways.
We should be open to expecting the unexpected.
We should pray for those who are struggling.
We should have faith in God, even when things don't go our way. The story of the Road to Emmaus shows how Jesus can come alongside us in unexpected ways, and give us hope when we are struggling. We should be grateful for God's presence in our lives, and pray for those who are struggling. We should renew our commitment to discipleship, and live our lives in a way that honors God.
Have faith in God, even when things don't go your way.

19:27 - Opening Prayers

22:04 - 24:40 - Reading: John 20. 1 – 18 NIVUK 

24:53 - 30:04 - Talk for all ages
Eggs have been given during this time of year before Christianity because it represents new life in spring.
Jesus' new life is different from a physical life because he is outside of time and space.
To change and experience new life, one must break out of their shell, just as a chick must peck out of an egg.
God calls us to live a loving life and trust in Him, which may require breaking out of our old habits and fears.
Jesus has already broken through death and sin, and through Him, we can find a new life.
The Easter message is that Jesus' resurrection brings new life and the possibility of eternal life.

30:14 - 32:44 - Hymn R&amp;S 246: The day of resurrection

33:12 - 34:46 - Reading: Acts 10. 34 – 43 NIVUK read by Sarah and Samuel Evans

The power of first impressions.
A TV advert that illustrates the importance of getting the full picture before making judgments.
First impressions can lead to error and prejudice.
The Easter story and the power of first impressions.
Mary Magdalene's initial impression upon finding the empty tomb was reasonable.
Peter and John rushed to verify Mary's report but only saw that the body was gone.
Mary stayed at the tomb and encountered Jesus again.
The wonder and mystery of the Resurrection are beyond human understanding.
Waiting on God and risking vulnerability can lead to a deeper understanding of truth.
The truth of the Resurrection is that Jesus Christ is risen.

46:26 - 50:28 - Hymn - R&amp;S 107 The love of God comes close

06:13 - Welcome 
07:30 - Introduction and call to worship (from Isaiah 53 and John 1.29)

He was despised and rejected  a man of suffering and
acquainted with grief; he was despised, and held of no
account.

All: Yet he was wounded for our transgressions,
crushed for our iniquities;

Upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by
his bruises we are healed. All we like sheep have gone
astray; we have all turned to our own way,
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

Behold the lamb of God who takes away
the sin of the world.
Thanks be to God for the cross of Christ,
Sign of God’s love for the world.
We offer our thanks and praise
this good and holy day. Amen.

Palm crosses are a symbol of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem because they are made from palm leaves, which were used to welcome Jesus into the city.
Palm crosses are a symbol of victory because they represent Jesus' victory over death.
Palm crosses are a reminder of Jesus' suffering and death because they represent the cross that Jesus was crucified on.
Palm crosses are a symbol of hope and new life because they represent Jesus' resurrection.
Palm crosses can be recycled or composted because they are made from natural materials.
WaterAid is a charity that provides clean water and sanitation to people in need around the world.
Sado is a girl from Ethiopia who had to walk five hours to collect water every day because she lived in a village that did not have access to clean water.
Malala is a girl from Madagascar who can now go to school because of a water tap in her village. The water tap was installed by WaterAid.
Palm crosses are a symbol of our connection to the world church and to people in need around the world because they are made by people in Tanzania and used by Christians all over the world.

Introduction to the reading

Reading: Philippians 2.5-11 NIVUK read by Norma
 
44:38 - 46:15 - Hymn - My song is love unknown (vs. 1 and 2 only)
46:25 - Prayer

46:56 - 55:33 - Short Address
You don't need a long sermon, you just need a Palm Cross to connect you with the world church
A palm cross connects us with the World Church and with the crowd that welcomed Jesus on Palm Sunday.
The crowd that welcomed Jesus was a mixture of people, some curious, some caught up in the Jesus movement, and some who wanted something new.
Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was a protest against the way things were, with Roman and religious authorities pressing down on the people.
Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was also a celebration of an alternative way of life, based on love and justice.
The crowd welcomed Jesus with palm branches and cloaks, symbolizing their willingness to lay down their lives for him.
Jesus's death on the cross was a sacrifice for the sins of the world and a victory over hatred and division.
We are called to follow Jesus's example of humility, love, and forgiveness.
We are called to work for justice and peace in the world.
Palm Sunday is a time to reflect on the meaning of Jesus's life and death and to commit ourselves to following him.
Palm Sunday is a time to celebrate the hope and joy that Jesus brings to the world.

23:11 - 27:20 - Introductory Talk
What makes us human?
What helps bring people down to earth?
What makes people human is their ability to connect with others and to show compassion.
We are all connected, even if we don't always feel it.
We should never underestimate the power of a simple act of kindness.
The Queen, Tony Blair, and the Bishop of Birmingham are all examples of how humanity can be seen in everyday life.
The story of Lazarus shows how Jesus' humanity intrudes in the most interesting way.
Jesus is not just a divine being, but also a human being who can understand and empathize with our suffering.
We should always strive to connect with others and to show compassion.
Even the smallest act of kindness can make a difference in someone's life.
We should never forget that we are all human and that we should treat each other with respect and dignity.
The world would be a better place if we all made an effort to be more human.

33:37 - 39:17 - John 11: 1-45 read by David and Valerie Bishop
Reader 1 verses 1-7, 17-27,38-46
Reader 2 verses 7-16, 28-37

39:43 - 41:55 - Hymn R&amp;S 518 Father, I place into your hands

42:02 - 56:45 - Sermon (followed by time of quiet reflection)
The story of Lazarus is a story of hope, as it shows that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of resurrection.
Jesus is human and experiences grief, as he weeps for Lazarus. This shows that Jesus is not just a divine being, but also a human being who can understand and empathize with our suffering.
Jesus is the resurrection and the life, as he raises Lazarus from the dead. This shows that Jesus has the power to overcome death and bring new life to those who believe in him.
The story of Lazarus is a sign of God's glory, as it shows that God is powerful and can bring new life out of death.
We should raise our awareness of signs of hope, as there are many things in the world that give us hope, even in the midst of difficult times.
We should empower our community to do the same, as we can all work together to spread hope and light in the world.
We should wait patiently for the resurrection, as we know that one day Jesus will return and make all things new.
We should not be afraid to weep, as it is natural to feel grief when we lose someone we love.
We should trust in Jesus, as he is the only one who can truly give us hope and life.
We should believe in the resurrection, as it is the foundation of our faith and the hope of our salvation.

12:37 - 16:14 - Introduction: How do you pray? How do you see, imagine or

Thinking about how we picture God on Mothering Sunday.
Different names for God, such as Lord Almighty, King of Creation, and Alpha and Omega.
God is referred to as our Father in Heaven and Father of All.
Jesus is a way to think about who God is.
God is described as a friend, savior, and someone to speak to.
There are many ways to think about and pray to God.

16:16 - Introduction to the reading

17:31 - 18:20 - 1 st Reading: Psalm 131 (The Message) read by Jeany Bien

18:30 - 19:35 - Prayer

19:56 - 22:17 - Song MP 1076 Jesus be the centre

23:14 - 23:36 - 2nd Reading Luke 13.34 read by Kitty Bird
Jesus said, ‘Jerusalem…How often have I desired to gather your
children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and
you were not willing!’

23:42 - 29:54 - Short talk: ‘Mothering – instinct to protect’
Linking to the reading where Jesus pictures himself as a mother hen.
The instinct of protecting their young is shared among animals, including elephants, lions, cows, and birds.
It's important to respect animals' protective instincts when we come close to them.
Jesus longs to protect the human family and lead them into a better way of security, safety, peace, and dignity.
Imagine ourselves and other people as little chicks or goslings under the wing of Jesus.
Mothering Sunday is not just about celebrating biological mothers but also all kinds of people who care and protect others.
The importance of empathy and understanding in mothering.
The speaker encourages the audience to think about how they can protect and care for others.


30:39 - 33:52 - Song MP 583 Safe in the shadow of the Lord

35:20 - 36:02 - 3rd reading Matthew 12.46-50 NIVUK read by Kitty Bird
46  While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and
brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.  47  Someone told
him, ‘Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to
speak to you.’
48  He replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my
brothers?’  49  Pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother
and my brothers.  50  For whoever does the will of my Father in
heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’

36:09 - 36:44 - 4th Reading: John 19.26-27 read by Jeany Bien
26  When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he
loved standing near by, he said to her, ‘Woman, here is your
son,’  27  and to the disciple, ‘Here is your mother.’ From that time
on, this disciple took her into his home.

36:52 - 45:22 - Short Talk: ‘God’s new family’
Jesus welcomes all who follow him to be part of God's family.
People in church who show care and interest in others make a difference.
The church family can have arguments and divisions, but we are part of an amazing family of God.
Jesus entrusted his mother to John to care for her and play his part in the family of God.
We give thanks for mothers, physical or adoptive, as well as fathers who may play a maternal role.
Men and women can share the role of being a mother to their children.
We give thanks for brothers and sisters in the family of God, as well as children and those who have cared for us.
Mothering Sunday can be an emotional day with many different emotions.
