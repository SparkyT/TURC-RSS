Hymn: R&amp;S 123 Think of a world

39:04 - 57:10 -  Address: followed by time of quiet reflection
The story discusses an abandoned lighthouse that was converted by a local artist into a climbing center for youth, shining a symbolic light when they reach the top, as well as a Methodist church that wants to serve its struggling community by offering its building to help distribute secondhand children's clothing and &quot;shine a light&quot; by helping people live better lives even if they don't attend church.
The lighthouse was abandoned and there were unsuccessful plans to convert it into a museum, restaurant, or flats.
Tam McCarthy had a vision to convert it into a climbing center to help the local youth.
Tam was a local artist who became successful and gave back to the community.
The climbing center at the lighthouse became very popular and successful.
The light at the top of the lighthouse is lit when someone reaches the top, symbolizing their achievement.
Many local Methodist churches have closed down and they want to keep their church open.
They want to use their building to serve the community even if people don't attend church.
An example is allowing a group to distribute secondhand children's clothing from the church.
Church activities don't have to directly involve the church, the goal is to help the community.
They hope to metaphorically &quot;shine a light&quot; and help people live better lives even if they don't attend church.

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00:00 - Music before the service

07:19 - Entry of the bible

07:39 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

10:47 - Call to worship: verses from Psalm 50 
The mighty one, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
Our God comes and does not keep silent; 
before him  is a devouring fire and a mighty tempest all around him.
He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he  may judge his people:
‚ÄúGather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!‚Äù
The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. 

13:12 - Hymn: R&amp;S 373 Lord Jesus Christ, we have come to you

16:25 - Opening Prayers and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer

19:30 - 28:49 - Introduction to the theme
God's mystery and wonder, focusing on mountaintop experiences like Jesus' transfiguration.
Has anyone had any special experiences recently
Flowers from the garden like snowdrops that lift the heart after winter.
In the transfiguration story, Jesus took his closest disciples Peter, James and John up a mountain.
Jesus was transfigured, his clothes shining white, with Moses and Elijah appearing.
The disciples were terrified by this divine vision showing Jesus' glory.
God's voice affirms Jesus as his Son, saying to listen to him.
Like baptism and Jesus' birth, this is a rare moment where heaven meets earth.
The transfiguration comes as Jesus heads toward his death, affirming God's plan.
We should listen for God's wonder and mystery as we gather in faith.
Glimpses of God's divine wonder and mystery in mountaintop spiritual experiences like Jesus' transfiguration, where he was affirmed by Moses, Elijah and God's voice as the beloved Son, and similarly at his baptism and birth.

Readings:  
29:40 - 32:31 - 2 Kings 2:1-12 read by Sue
32:46 - 34:21 - Mark 9:2-9 read by Abigail

34:51 - 37:14 - Hymn:  R&amp;S 572 Colours of day dawn into the mind

37:49 - 01:00:23 - Address:  Christ revealed  - followed by time of quiet reflection 
The readings involve mystery and symbolism, raising questions rather than giving clear answers.
The story of Elijah and Elisha - Elisha asks to take on Elijah's spirit before Elijah is taken up to heaven.
The story foreshadows Elisha becoming the next prophet and inheriting a &quot;double portion&quot; of Elijah's spirit.
There are visions, miracles and God's power in the stories.
The Transfiguration shows Jesus' divine nature as well as his humanity.
We are all created in God's image and should reflect God's glory in our actions.
We can glimpse God's glory in ordinary things like nature, a baby being born, a friend's wisdom.
Lent is a time for pause, reflection and prayer as we approach Easter.
A smile each day in Lent can spread joy and reflect God's light in us.
We need feeding from God's light like solar panels need sunlight.

01:00:49 - 01:03:30 - Hymn: R&amp;S 67   Immortal, Invisible, God only wise (tune: Haresfield)

01:03:32 - 01:10:13 - Prayers of Intersession
 Response:   Lord in your mercy  Hear our prayer

01:10:23 - 01:13:34 - Hymn:  Christ triumphant

01:13:36 - 01:14:13 - Closing blessing 

01:14:36 - 01:19:24 - Music after the service

12:34 - 16:07 - Intro to theme: What makes you feel better when you‚Äôre feeling down? 
What makes people feel better when feeling down, with answers like music and chocolate.
Favorite hymns and films that lift their spirits when down.
What makes us feel better needs to be the right remedy for the situation.
One of the best ways to help people feel better is to care for them and show love.
Caring for yourself when a carer
TV and radio provide comfort but don't replace real company.
Jesus was very concerned for the weak and ill.
People were always looking for Jesus, but he would withdraw to pray and recharge.
These words can help discover the healing that comes through faith in God.
Things that can make people feel better when they are down, from music to care and company, noting that the remedy should fit the need.  
Jesus' practice of withdrawing from demanding crowds to pray and renew his spirit to serve others.

30:19 - 45:53 - Sermon: ‚ÄúA rich feast‚Äù followed by short time of silence
The Old Testament and Psalm readings portray God as great, caring for people in exile.
The gospel shows Jesus healing and taking time to pray and listen to God.
We can experience healing by knowing God loves and cares for us.
Paul says preaching the gospel is compelled by God, not something to boast about.
Working at the airport learning other ways to share faith.
Actions can preach, but words are still needed to share the hope within us.
Short conversations can lead to emotional healing by changing perspectives.
God still sustains the weak and powerless today through Jesus.
We are called to proclaim in word and deed the message of new life in Christ.

23:15 - 24:25 - Readings: Revelation 12 vv 1 ‚Äì 5a read by Alan Yates

24:43 Hymn - R&amp;S 332 Jesus lover of my soul

29:10 - 38:38 - Address
Reflecting on school days and strict teachers like the headmaster who also served in church.
The Bible passage about Jesus' teaching makes us think about impactful teachers.
Jesus taught with authority unlike the rabbis who referenced earlier teachings.
Jesus was confident in his identity as God's Son which integrated his character and teaching.
We should also be ready to give account of our hope without just appealing to the past.
Jesus' words had immediate impact, like healing the man. His message was freedom.
Jesus walked the walk, not just talked. We should have integrating words and actions.
Jesus earned authority by freeing and helping people, not from any office.
We need to know our beloved identity in Christ through baptism and worship.
Our everyday words and actions should bring God's kingdom like Jesus did.
We are reminded to internalize our Christian identity so that our actions align with our words in bringing positive change, rather than relying solely on past teaching.

07:43 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able),

07:53 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

09:37 - Call to worship

10:27 - 12:22 - Hymn - R&amp;S 565 Jesus stand among us

12:25 - Prayer of adoration
14:17 - Lord‚Äôs Prayer

15:00 - 28:18 - Introduction for all ages: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äô
Material for the week prepared by Christians in Burkina Faso focused on the Good Samaritan parable and loving your neighbor. 
Burkina Faso is experiencing major unrest and terrorism, with over 2 million displaced people.
Links to a couple previously held hostage there that we prayed for. 
The importance of welcoming others, like Abraham and Sarah showing hospitality to angel visitors. Ways to welcome include providing refreshments and making people comfortable.


28:48 - 30:05 - Reading: Genesis 18:1-8 Good News

WORSHIP SONGS
31:22 - MP 1221 Praise is rising
34:39 - MP 1046 Give thanks to the Lord our God and King

37:50 - Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place
(and we share a blessing ‚Äì the Lord be with you; and
also with you) or there are activities at back of church.

39:08 - 40:26 - Reading: Psalm 138 NIVUK read by Kitty Bird

40:36 - Prayer of confession with the response
Merciful God: forgive and heal us.

44:07 - 46:45 - Reading: Luke 10:25-37 NIVUK read by Larry Ogbewe

47:17 - Hymn - R&amp;S 309 Spirit of the Living God move among us

48:33 - 01:00:32 - Address - The Transforming Power of Love for Neighbour
The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us the meaning of loving our neighbor
The Good Samaritan went far beyond what was expected to care for the wounded stranger
We should not just pass by those in need but stop and truly help
Unity and reconciliation are needed in divided communities like Burkina Faso
Christians there are working together across denominations to help displaced people
We must have hope - &quot;the moment of reconciliation will come&quot;
The command to love God and neighbor matters more than religious laws and debates
We must move from seeing &quot;neighbor&quot; as a noun to becoming a neighbor through action
We can collaborate to be Good Samaritans addressing desperation in our own communities
Love never ends - it bears, believes, hopes and endures all things
Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan, focusing on the Samaritan's loving action towards the wounded stranger. This radical care for neighbor should inspire Christians today, even in divided communities, to work together in reconciliation and service. 

01:00:33 - Affirmation of Love (verses from 1 Corinthians 13)

01:03:18 - 01:05:31 - Hymn - R&amp;S 648 Jesu, Jesu fill us with your love

01:05:33 - 01:09:37 - Prayers of intercession with the response
Fill us with your love: make us one in you.

01:10:57 - Closing Prayer (from the Daily Prayer for Christian Unity
of the Chemin Neuf Community)
Lord Jesus, who prayed that all might be one,
we pray to you for the unity of all Christians,
according to your will, according to your means.
May your Spirit enable us to experience
the suffering caused by division,
to see our sin and to hope beyond all hope. Amen.

01:11:58 - 01:14:02 - Hymn R&amp;S 647 In Christ there is no East or West

01:14:03 - 01:14:28 - Blessing

01:14:55 - 01:18:34 - Music after the service
