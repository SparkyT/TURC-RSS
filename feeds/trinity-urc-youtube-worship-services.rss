29:59 - 43:32 - Short Address 
Reflecting on what it means to be human from a faith perspective.
Psalm 8, which contrasts human insignificance with God's mindfulness of humanity.
The destructive aspects of human behavior, including environmental damage and war.
Jesus' welcome of children is highlighted as a radical act in its historical context.
The praise of children is presented as a powerful force against evil.
The psalm speaks of humanity being crowned with glory and honor by God.
Jesus is described as the truest human, who has shared in human suffering.
The creation of a new human family through Jesus' grace is emphasized.
Being human involves recognizing our insignificance while also embracing our God-given dignity.

This sermon explores the complex nature of humanity through a Christian lens, drawing on Psalm 8 and the teachings of Jesus. It grapples with the paradox of human insignificance in the face of the universe's vastness, while also affirming the unique value and responsibility God places on humanity. The speaker addresses both the destructive capacities of humans and their potential for compassion and praise. Jesus is presented as the model of true humanity, offering a path to a new family united by divine grace. The sermon concludes by defining being human as a balance between humility before God and the honor of being part of God's creation, with the communion table serving as a symbol of this united humanity.

Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus travelled along the border

men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called
out in a loud voice, ‘Jesus, Master, have pity on us!.
When he saw them, he said ‘Go, show yourself to the priests.’ And
as they went they were cleansed.
One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back in a loud
voice. He threw himself at Jesus feet and thanked him – and he was
a Samaritan.

40:16 - 43:18 - HYMN R&amp;S 353 There’s a wideness in God’s mercy

43:25 - 52:51 - Short Address
Questions are an integral part of faith and shouldn't be denied.
The Christian journey involves asking big questions without fear.
Hebrew scriptures lacked punctuation, leaving room for interpretation.
Questions can be asked with different intentions - some seek answers, others make points.
Open-mindedness is crucial when asking questions in faith.
The sermon explores various types of questions in biblical passages.
God asks heartfelt questions to humanity through prophets.
The prophets convey God's longing for people to return to Him.
Micah's question &quot;What does the Lord require of you?&quot; is central to the sermon.
The sermon concludes with three key actions: act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.

52:57 - 54:44 - Affirmation based on Micah 4. 2 – 5
Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
to the house of the God of Jacob;
that God may teach us his ways
and that we may walk in his paths.
God shall judge between many peoples,
and shall arbitrate between strong nations
They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
and their spears into pruning-hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.
All shall sit under their own vines and under their own fig
trees, and no one shall make them afraid;
for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.
For all the peoples walk, each in the name of their god.
We will walk in the name of the Lord our God
for ever and ever.

56:07 - 01:04:09 - Prayers of intercession using TP 75 Peace I give to you

01:04:10 - Offering Prayer
God of all life,
You do not desire the sacrifice of animals or rivers of oil,
but rather justice and loving kindness.
So help us by your Spirit,
to practice justice and fairness
to love kindness and compassion
and to walk each day humbly with you,
our Gracious God and the God of all life.
We pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.

01:05:48 - 01:08:40 - HYMN R&amp;S 601 Christ is the world’s true light

We come before God held in the knowledge we are loved,
and with assurance that we are transformed through
God’s love.
Loving shepherd, we come to you to confess
That there are times when we live like sheep without a
shepherd. Times we allow our busyness to drive us from
places of rest.
Times we choose paths of discord rather than loving
kindness.
Times we embrace despair rather than hope
Jesus is the good shepherd who has pity on his flock
And promises goodness and love will be with us
Follow your shepherd on the right paths,
And do so in the knowledge you are loved and forgiven.
Amen.

we offer our gifts of money and the gift of our lives.
Use them for good, as we seek to serve you and our
fellow humans in love. Amen.

Jesus portrayed as accepting marginalized groups, including women, the sick, and the poor.
The story of the woman with the issue of blood is highlighted as an example of Jesus' compassion.
God's redemptive work in the midst of chaos is emphasized throughout scripture.
Jesus' mission described as recovering the personhood of those marginalized by society.
The church is called to challenge systems that maintain inequality and injustice.
Christians are encouraged to reimagine their communities through God's love.
Jesus' interaction with the woman demonstrates his protection of her dignity and identity.
The sermon concludes with a call for the church to be invitational and inclusive, showing compassion to all.

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00 - Music before the service

04:30 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

04:43 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

05:59 - Call to worship (from Psalm 104)
Praise the LORD, my soul!
Lord my God, how great you are!
You make springs flow in the valleys,
and rivers run between the hills.
In the trees near by, the birds make their nests and sing.
From the sky you send rain on the hills,
and the earth is filled with your blessings.
All creatures – and we ourselves - depend on you:
when you open your hand, all are satisfied
with good things.

07:22 - 10:06 - HYMN R&amp;S 117 O Lord my God (vs. 1 and 2 only)

10:10 - Opening Prayer with the response
For all your gifts and blessings:
We praise you, God of all people.

17:55 - 22:34 - Introduction: ‘Elijah the outsider’

23:21 - 25:07 - Reading: 1 Kings 17. 1 – 10 read by Rosemary Taylor

25:35 - 36:30 - Talk: ‘Fed by the ravens!’
The importance of serving God, not idols or selfish interests, like Elijah served the God of Israel.
The story of Elijah being fed by ravens highlights humanity's interconnectedness with nature.
Questioning the belief that humans are superior to nature and can live without it.
The story of the widow's unending flour and oil symbolizes God's provision in times of scarcity.
The valuable role of the poor widow in helping Elijah.
Jesus referenced the story of the widow, praising those who give even a cup of water.
The need for recognizing interdependence and reliance on God.
Jesus' teaching about God's care for even small sparrows.
Praying to God as a caring, heavenly Father.

Pause: ‘Happy Father’s Day!’

36:48 - Lord’s Prayer

37:40 - 40:29 - HYMN R&amp;S 64 I lift my eyes to the quiet hills

40:40 - 44:00 - Consider: How do you react to a crisis or a danger in your
life? Do you prefer to ‘fight’ or prefer ‘flight’ or simply
‘freeze’?!

44:04 - 47:06 - Reading: 1 Kings 19.9 – 20a read by Norma Garden

47:19 - 57:44 - Reflection: ‘meeting God in the silence’
Elijah depressed and in self-pity after his triumph over the prophets of Baal.
Elijah catastrophized, feeling alone and that everyone had deserted him except for God.
God questioned Elijah's presence in the cave, calling him out of his despair and isolation.
Rather than appearing in dramatic natural phenomena, God came to Elijah in a &quot;gentle whisper&quot; or &quot;still small voice.&quot;
Contrast the noise of our world with the stark silence Elijah experienced in the cave.
Silence is challenging yet powerful, allowing space for God's voice amidst the inner noise of thoughts.
Different translations describing God's voice as a &quot;soft whisper,&quot; &quot;sound of sheer silence,&quot; and &quot;still small voice.&quot;
Elijah realized he was in the presence of the holy God, covering his face in response.
God met Elijah not in dramatic displays but in the stillness and quiet whisper.


Ponder: ‘We spend most of our lives focussed on three
verbs: to want, to have and to do. But none of these verbs
has any ultimate significance until it is transcended by and
included in the fundamental verb: to be.’ (Evelyn Underhill)

58:25 - 01:00:32 - HYMN MP 48 Be still and know that I am God

01:00:59 - Further Exploration: ‘Jesus and Elijah’

01:03:26 - 01:05:53 - Reading: Matthew 17. 1 – 13 read by Terry

01:06:11 - 01:10:58 - HYMN R&amp;amp;S 492 Dear Lord and Father of mankind

01:11:19 - 01:18:48 - Prayers for the church and the world using verses of
HYMN TP 56 Kum ba ya

01:19:04 - 01:21:59 - HYMN R&amp;S 531 Lord of all hopefulness

01:22:00 - 01:22:17 - Blessing

01:22:47 - 01:25:31 - Music after the service

00:00 - Music before the service

07:49 - Entry of the Bible

07:58 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

10:01 - Call to worship 

10:59 - 14:07 - HYMN R&amp;S 102  Praise the Lord

14:08 - 16:00 - Prayer of adoration and confession 

16:08 - 24:49 - Introduction for all ages: ‘Nothing like a good story’
Favourite stories, parables, and losing things

25:27 - 27:02 - Reading: Luke 15. 1 – 10 NIVUK read by Lesley Bogart

29:14 - 31:17 - HYMN CP 695  God has given us a book full of stories
31:25 - 33:06 - TP 31  Give thanks with a grateful heart
(Activities for children are available during the service)


34:18 - 39:41 - Talk - Prophets
The role of prophets in ancient Israel, including major and minor prophets in the Old and New Testaments.
Prophets were honest truth-tellers close to God, sometimes speaking out at great personal cost.
Prophecy involved discerning the signs of the times and God's wisdom, not just future predictions.
There were also female prophets like Miriam, Deborah, and Isaiah's wife, though less known.
The story of the prophet Nathan confronting King David over his sin with Bathsheba is examined.
David abused his power by summoning Bathsheba and impregnating her, then ordering her husband Uriah's death.
Nathan uses a parable to make David realize his guilt before directly accusing him.
The prophets called for repentance and change, as the future was not set.
David repents after Nathan's confrontation, though he still faces consequences.
Prophecy involved speaking truth to power, even to kings who could have the prophet killed.

40:00 - 42:21 - Reading: 2 Samuel 12. 1 – 10 NIVUK read by Ian Bogart

43:35 - 47:37 - HYMN R&amp;S 621  Almighty Father

47:41 - 01:00:06 - Short Address 
Jesus was dismissed as just a carpenter when he returned to his hometown of Nazareth, but he embraced the title of prophet.
Honoring the prophets and hearing what they have to say, especially during political campaigns filled with empty words and promises.
The story of the prophet Nathan confronting King David about his sin with Bathsheba is examined.
Nathan uses a parable to make David realize his own guilt before directly accusing him, showing the power of stories.
Prophets are called to speak truth to power, even at great personal risk.
There are consequences for sin, as seen in David's family being divided by conflict after his actions.
However, genuine repentance like David's leads to God's forgiveness, though consequences may still remain.
A parallel between the injustice done to the poor man's lamb and the injustice of Jesus' death.
Encouraging hearing the stories of the poor and marginalized in society.
Despite sin and tragedy, there is hope for a new beginning through God's grace and truth.

01:01:29 - 01:06:27 - Prayers of intercession with the response
Lord, may your kingdom of justice and joy come:
your loving will be done.

Communion: all invited to share in the bread and wine (non-alcoholic grape juice) to remember Jesus.

01:10:29 - HYMN TP 48  Jesus calls us here

01:10:59 - 01:12:57 - Prayer of thanksgiving 
The Lord’s Prayer (traditional words)

01:13:04 - 01:18:56 - Distribution of communion 
Closing Prayer

01:19:11 - 01:21:24 - HYMN R&amp;S 30  Father we love you

01:21:25 - 01:21:52 - Blessing

00:00 - Music before the service

03:21 - Entry of the Bible

03:37 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

05:48 - Call to Worship (Psalm 27. 1 – 4)

06:50 - 10:46 - HYMN R&amp;S 121 The God of Abraham praise

11:19 - Opening Prayers
Lord’s Prayer

14:16 - 17:07 - Reading: John 3. 1 – 17 read by Alan Yates

17:19 - 22:03 - Introduction to the service (All age talk)
The film &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; starring Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle.
In the film, two criminals disguise themselves as nuns to hide in a convent after a bank robbery.
The Mother Superior allows them to stay but requires them to work like the other nuns.
A humorous scene where Eric Idle's character, Sister Immaculata, tries to explain the Holy Trinity to a class of teenage girls.
Sister Immaculata uses a three-leaf clover to illustrate the concept of the Trinity.
A triangle, being a strong shape, can represent the strength and self-supporting nature of the Trinity.
Parallels between the three sides of the triangle and the three persons of the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
The Trinity is a difficult concept for humans to fully understand.
However, the triangle analogy can help provide a partial understanding of how God can be three persons in one.
Think about the triangle next time you contemplate the Trinity, as it represents God's ability to be Father, Son, and Holy Spirit simultaneously.

22:15 - 25:47 - HYMN R&amp;S 34 Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty

26:00 - 27:12 - Reading: Romans 8. 12 – 17 read by Kate Yates

27:31 - 34:16 - HYMN R&amp;amp;S 36 I bind unto myself today

34:25 - 42:58 - Address
The comedy series Dad's Army and a humorous scene about choir admission forms.
The ancient Athanasian Creed, which explains the doctrine of the Holy Trinity.
The Creed stresses that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, yet distinct persons.
The Trinity is a difficult concept for many Christians to comprehend.
However, the Trinity represents a model of perfect balance, communion, and relationship within God.
There is no domination or power struggle among the three persons, only absolute love.
The Trinitarian relationship is meant to be an example for human relationships and love.
Through Christ, believers are mysteriously drawn into this relationship of divine love.
The Trinity is not just an academic doctrine but part of the believer's experience of God.
The image of God as a loving Trinity is stamped into human beings from creation.

43:28 - 46:05 - HYMN R&amp;S 38 Thou Whose Almighty word

46:10 - 51:40 - Prayers of intercession

51:59 - 54:39 - HYMN R&amp;S 405 Angel voices ever singing

54:39 - 55:01 - Blessing

55:25 - 59:10 - Music after the service
