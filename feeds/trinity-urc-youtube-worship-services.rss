12:48 - 13:57 - Prayer of approach

14:06 - 28:13 - Introduction for all ages: ‘Well, that’s agreed.’
Agreements are everywhere: from personal promises to international treaties.
We make agreements formally (weddings, mortgages) and informally (meeting friends).
Agreements involve commitments, obligations, and sometimes consequences.
Technology shapes many agreements today, through cookies, terms of service, etc.
Citizenship involves implicit agreements with our country.
Agreements can evolve and change over time.
Broken agreements can have major consequences, from personal conflicts to war.
The Bible is full of important agreements, starting with Noah's rainbow covenant.
God's covenant with humanity involves both God's commitment and ours.
The Ten Commandments are a key part of God's covenant with his people.
Our lives are woven with agreements, both big and small, shaping our relationships with each other, our planet, and even God.

43:05 - 52:24 - Short Address - Renewing and strengthening ourselves for God's work in the world
The sermon reflects on a new year's beginning and our relationship with God.
It asks how comfortable we are in our faith and if we feel &quot;at home&quot; with Jesus.
Three key things are identified for remaining in Jesus: abiding, dwelling, and remaining in his love.
Challenges include finding stillness, meditating, and letting go of negativity.
We're called to bear fruit, not through self-effort, but through Jesus' power working in us.
The church is seen as a power station to renew and strengthen us for God's work in the world.
We're invited to renew our covenant with God through prayer and commitment.
The sermon emphasizes God's love and the call to share that love with the world.
It challenges us to offer our gifts and talents to God's work.
The overall message is one of hope, renewal, and purpose as we embark on a new year.
The sermon calls us to deepen our relationship with God in the new year, bearing fruit through his love and strengthening each other for his work in the world.

53:05 - Prayer: ‘Renewing our agreement with God’
Eternal God, Lord of heaven and earth,
trusting in your great love for us and for the world,
we offer our lives anew to you.
We recommit ourselves to walk the Way of Jesus,
to seek your will for our lives and for our world,
to pray and work for your kingdom of justice and joy.
By your Spirit, unite us and renew us,
that we may be channels of your love and peace,
through Jesus Christ our Saviour and Lord. Amen.

We come to worship Jesus Christ,

God with us now and for ever.

07:21 - 11:07 - Hymn - R&amp;S 160 O come all ye faithful (omit verses 3 and 4)

Celebrating the Light that darkness cannot overcome

11:12 - 12:47 - Reading: John 1.1 – 5, 9 – 14  read by Sue Thorne 

13:19 - 15:41 - Lighting the Advent Candles
We light each candle to remember those who played their part
preparing the way for Jesus, Emmanuel, God with us, but we leave
the second candle unlit in solidarity with the church in Bethlehem
and to remember all who are suffering in that region today; and
now we light the central candle to celebrate the birth of Jesus, the
child of Bethlehem, the Saviour of the world:
Lord Jesus, be with us in all our celebrations this day.
Shine your light into our lives. Bring your love, hope and peace
to our broken world, that all creation may learn the song of the
angels: Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth. Amen.
A photo is taken to send to churches in the holy land.

16:18 - 20:12 - Hymn - R&amp;S 163 Angels from the realms of glory

20:38 - 25:52 - Opening the gift
#ColmersHill #DougChalk
Opened gifts early - socks, calendar, rubik's cube
Share gifts - photo of excited granddaughter
Box of Christmas decorations passed around
Different Quality Street favorites - celebrating in different ways
Nativity scene showed after travels
Constructed manger scene, but it was delicate
Missing baby Jesus figure for the scene
Jesus is the reason for the season
We get distracted by presents and traditions
Focus should be on Jesus' humble birth

In this Christmas sermon, we share gifts they've already opened and pass around a box of decorations to help construct a nativity scene. This reminds us that though we celebrate in different ways, Jesus is the reason behind it all. We often get distracted by presents and traditions, losing sight of the humble birth of our Savior that we are actually celebrating.

26:04 - 27:11 - Reading: Luke 2. 4 – 12 read by a member of the Sparks family

28:15 - 30:49 - Hymn - R&amp;S 151 See him lying on a bed of straw

33:21 - 35:17 - Hymn - R&amp;S 149 Infant lowly, infant holy
35:21 - Wishing those online and in person a happy christmas 

35:48 - 39:40 - Praying for the world God loves
Prayers with the response
God with us, be with them.
Lord’s Prayer

39:41 - 40:14 - Christmas Blessing

40:35 - 42:51 - Hymn - R&amp;S 161 Good Christians all, rejoice

Retiring Collection for Embrace the Middle East

   <media:description>00:00:00 - Music before the service

04:12 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able),

04:26 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

05:30 - Short time of quiet to prepare for worship

06:29 - Call to worship – Lighting of the Advent Candles

The unlit candle is a
reminder of all who have suffered or died since the conflict
began in Israel and Gaza in October. Our prayers go out to all

those who are suffering in the Holy Land – of all faiths and
none – and all who are striving for bring an end to war, hatred
and bitterness. We light the third candle to remember John
the Baptist, who called people to change their ways. And now
we light the fourth candle to give thanks for Mary who played
her part in the saving work of God.
God of hope, come to us again,
as we prepare to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.
May the light of your love be born anew in us.

09:04 - 12:21 - Hymn R&amp;S 74 Praise to the Lord, the Almighty

12:37 - 22:09 - Introduction to the theme: ‘Interesting times’
Hopes that &quot;new normal&quot; post-COVID would be kinder, more helpful world faded as things returned to old ways
Heathrow airport went from ghost town during lockdowns to busy madness again
Politics and conflicts resumed as usual
But light still shines in darkness through God's love and presence
Mary coped with her huge life change by trusting God's promises
We can cope through faith, prayer, love of others
People have always lived in changing, uncertain times
Mary said yes to God's call, despite risks
We may hesitate to follow God's call due to doubts, fears
God is faithful; we can trust Him like Mary did

17:25 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

22:19 - 26:04 - Hymn R&amp;S 274 God is love, his the care

26:17 - Offering Prayer – offering our thanks, gifts and prayers
Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and we
share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and also with you) or
there are activities at the back of church.

28:05 - Introduction to Bible readings

28:47 - 31:39 - Readings: 2 Samuel 7. 1 – 11 and 16 read by Rosemary Taylor

31:57 - 33:52 - Luke 1. 26 – 38 read by Kate Yates

34:53 - 38:00 - Hymn - R&amp;S 740 Tell out my soul. (Tune Woodlands)

38:14 - 53:55 - Sermon (followed by time of quiet reflection)
David, Nathan, Mary all lived in changing, uncertain times
David wanted to build a temple for God, but God had other plans
Nathan had to deliver hard message to David about God's actual plans
God keeps his promises - David's lineage continues to Jesus
Exile was a hard time, but God was still with his people
Young Mary accepts God's call, despite the risks
Jesus fulfills God's promise to David and more
Pandemic helped us discover God outside of church buildings
We found new ways to be community and worship God
God's light still shines, calling us to serve in Jesus' name

Though David, Nathan, Mary and God's people faced uncertain times, God remained faithful, ultimately fulfilling his promise in Jesus' birth. During the pandemic, we rediscovered God's presence outside sanctuary walls, forming new communities in exile. But like Mary risking her reputation and safety in answering God’s call, we are asked to step out in faith, trusting God's plans are beyond our own. By serving as Jesus’ hands and feet, we reflect God's enduring light into the darkness.

54:04 - 55:38 - Hymn - R&amp;S 614 Love came down at Christmas

55:50 - 58:39 - Prayers for us and for the world

58:52 - 01:02:24 - Hymn - R&amp;S 192 Thou didst leave thy throne

01:02:26 - 01:03:11 - Blessing

01:03:35 - 01:10:44 - Music after the service

It seemed like a dream, too good to be true,
    when GOD returned Zion’s exiles.
We laughed, we sang,
    we couldn’t believe our good fortune.
We were the talk of the nations—
    “GOD was wonderful to them!”
GOD was wonderful to us;
    we are one happy people.
4-6  And now, GOD, do it again—
    bring rains to our drought-stricken lives
So those who planted their crops in despair
    will shout “Yes!” at the harvest,
So those who went off with heavy hearts
    will come home laughing, with armloads of blessing.
Thanks be to God for his word of hope and life.

14:32 - Lighting of the Advent Candle and prayer 

We light our first candle, as a sign of our hope that peace and justice will
come to our world.  Normally on this Sunday we light our second candle
to give thanks for the Bible that is indeed a light to guide and inspire us. 
This second candle is also known as the Bethlehem Candle.  This Advent
and Christmas all the lights that normally decorate Bethlehem, the
birthplace of Jesus, will remain unlit, because on the ongoing war in the
region.  We and United Reformed Churches across the country have
been invited to leave the second candle unlit all the way through Advent,
including Christmas Day, as a reminder that we stand in solidarity with all
those who are suffering in the Holy Land – of all faiths and none – and all
who are striving for bring an end to war, hatred and bitterness.
God of hope, come to us again this Advent.

May your Word be a lamp to our feet
and a light on our path. May peace and justice
come to the land of Jesus’ birth and the lights of
Bethlehem shine bright again. Amen.

16:59 - 19:25 - Hymn R&amp;S 134 One Jordon&amp;#39;s bank the Baptists cry

Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and we
share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and also with you) or
there are activities at the back of church.

Introduction to Bible readings

20:20 - 22:24 - Reading: Isaiah 40. 1 – 11 read by Ian Bogart

22:31 - 23:58 - Reading: 2 Peter 3. 8 – 14 read by Lesley Bogart

24:15 - 26:39 - Hymn R&amp;S 137 Hark the glad sound the Saviour comes

26:52 - 40:39 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection
The passage from Isaiah 40 provides comfort after judgment and suffering.
There is a shift to the post-exile era, with God promising to return to Jerusalem.
God's glory will be revealed again after a period of being hidden.
The prophet seeks to reassure the people of God's faithfulness.
God will return with might and will shepherd his people gently.
True comfort emerges from acknowledging suffering and the reality of sin.
We must turn ourselves fully over to God, like a lamb in the shepherd's arms.
The image of the good shepherd can seem intimidating rather than comforting.
Advent confronts the harsh realities of life before offering comfort.
We should not avoid discomfort in order to appreciate God's grace.

This thought-provoking sermon digs deep into the meaning of comfort in Isaiah 40. Facing the difficult realities of human weakness, it explores how God's care emerges through discomfort to offer true peace.

41:09 - 44:50 - Hymn R&amp;S 140 O Lord how shall I meet you

45:10 - 50:50 - Prayers of intercession (including an offering prayer)

51:08 - 54:41 - Hymn R&amp;S 579 Lord thy Church is seeking

   <media:description>Worship Led by Mr John Shaw

00:00 Music, notices, and photos

02:25 - Entry of the bible

02:40 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle , followed by a short time of quiet to prepare for worship

06:50 - Call to worship Psalm 95.1-7a

09:11 - 12:05 - Hymn Come let us praise the Lord  (Tune R&amp;S 657 Gopsal)

12:17 - 15:09 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

15:19 - 20:31 - Talk for all ages “The King is coming …”
A king sent word he would visit a small village.
The mayor prepared banners and tidied up to welcome the king.
But the king arrived disguised as a thirsty beggar asking for water.
The mayor brushed him aside, waiting for the real king who never came.
The mayor then learned the beggar was the king in disguise.
This story shows Jesus is present in every person we meet.
We should be kind to all, as we can't tell who Jesus will appear as.
At judgment, acts of kindness will matter more than status or wealth.
Seeing Jesus in others means serving without expecting reward.
It's failing to show love that makes us sheep or goats.

Through a simple story, the pastor conveyed that God calls us to serve the people right in front of us, regardless of status or appeal. Citing Jesus’ teaching that service to the “least” is accepted as service to God, it challenges the notion that worthiness should impact our willingness to meet basic needs with compassion. Christ himself ministers incognito in this world, reaching out through those deemed insignificant. The message – live expecting to glimpse divine glory in ordinary encounters.


20:42 - Hymn From heaven you came
 
26:00 - 28:34 - Reading: Matthew 25. 31-46 read by David 
The Sheep and the Goats


28:42 - 30:10 - Reading: Ephesians 1. 15-23 read by Valerie
Thanksgiving and Prayer


30:44 - 34:02 - Hymn Crown him with many crowns

35:16 - 01:01:34 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
The last 7 weeks have been difficult with events in the Middle East. It's hard not to ask &quot;where is God in this?&quot;.
But we know suffering is not God's doing - it's man's inhumanity to man.
We join the voices of lament and cries for help that have gone up for millennia.
Yet Scripture gives the full picture - God has promised to never abandon us.
Christ the King Sunday - Pope Pius XI established this feast to counter secularism and political leaders' supremacy claims.
The Bible readings clearly point to Christ's kingship and authority.
Jesus tells a story indicating the criteria for judgement will be acts of kindness to those in need.
We should see Jesus in the people we encounter and serve.
It's the good we fail to do that will determine whether we are sheep or goats.

This timely sermon on Christ the King Sunday calls us to look for Jesus in &quot;the least of these&quot; we encounter daily. Though lamenting recent tragic world events clearly stemming from humanity's brokenness, the preacher reminds us God suffers with victims of injustice and violence. While not ignoring the reality of evil, he focuses the message on our responsibility as followers of Christ to live out simple kindness and compassion. Using Jesus' parable of the sheep and goats, he makes clear we ignore this call at our eternal peril. Our criteria for judgment is caring for those in need with selfless, unconditional love as Christ modeled.

01:01:50 - Hymn - The Lord’s my shepherd (Townend version)

01:05:42 - 01:10:48 - Prayers for others and ourselves

01:11:05 - Hymn At the name of Jesus  (Tune Camberwell)             

01:14:35 - 01:14:54 - Closing blessing 

01:15:25 - 01:20:04 - Music after the service

20:10 - Faithful One, so unchanging MP 825

24:05 - Introducing the reading

25:30 - 26:45 - Reading Mark 4.35 – 41 (Good News) read by Larry Ogbewe

26:56 - 31:27 - Short talk; picture yourself in the boat with Jesus
Jesus often traveled, moving from village to village to share the good news.
One day Jesus had been teaching from a boat because there was no room on the shore.
After a long day of teaching parables, Jesus said let's go to the other side of the sea.
There were other boats traveling with Jesus and his disciples.
Imagine yourself as a disciple in the boat with Jesus. The boat is a symbol of the church.
A painting called Mystical Boat depicts two figures in a boat - a sailor and companion, like Jesus and disciples.
Think of yourself as the sailor with Jesus as your companion.
The sail reflects God's glory, the spirit blows the boat forward despite choppy waters.
The gospel reminds us we're on a journey of life and faith, with Jesus as our guide.
Jesus brightens and guides our lives.
In his travels, Jesus often taught from a boat when crowds gathered at the seashore. After a long day sharing parables, he sailed across the sea with his disciples. Though the waters were choppy, Jesus was there to steady the boat, just as he guides us through the rough waters of life. The boat reminds us that we're on a journey of faith, with Christ as our companion. Whatever storms we face, he navigates our course, shining like a beacon to give us hope. We must trust Jesus to see us through to the other side

31:30 - Activity at tables – make a paper boat (write your name on one
side and Jesus on the other, decorate etc)

42:27 - Song Jesus be the centre MP 1076

44:56 - COFFEE AND PASTRIES SERVED AT THE TABLES / TIME OF
FELLOWSHIP

54:01 - 54:43 - Return to the reading: Mark 4.37 – 38 read by Alan Yates

54:49 - 56:23 - Short Talk: Is Jesus sleeping?
The story leaves us thinking about the disciples in the boat when they thought Jesus didn't care they were going to die.
Storms suddenly hit us in life - physical storms with erratic weather.
We use the image of storms to describe challenges we and humanity and the church face.
With Jesus we have power to rebuke the storms and say &quot;Peace, be still!&quot;
Though the seas rage, Jesus calms the storms in our lives.
Sudden storms arise in our lives, both physical and metaphorical. As a church, we face many raging storms - division, decline, disillusionment. But just as Jesus calmed the storm for the disciples, he can bring stillness to our chaos. We must keep our eyes fixed on him, not the choppy seas of challenge nor our sinking hopes. Though the tempests won't cease, in the boat with Christ we find peace. Through the power of prayer we can rebuke the storms and proclaim &quot;Peace, be still!&quot; Jesus alone can calm the tempests in our hearts and grant us safe passage through the raging floods.


Activity ‘Storms and challenges of life’ – sharing at table areas for prayer for yourself or for others; each table to write these on a sheet and bring up for closing prayers.

08:42 - 17:52 - Talk For All Ages
It's Remembrance Sunday - we remember those who died in war.
Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan.
A man was robbed and left injured on the road to Jericho.
A priest and Levite passed by without helping.
A Samaritan stopped and helped the injured man.
Samaritans were disliked by Jews but showed love.
Jesus said to love our neighbor, even enemies.
We must remember to love all people.
Remembrance means loving those different than us.
Jesus calls us to love our neighbors and enemies.
Today's all age talk for Remembrance Sunday reflects on Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan. Though robbed and left injured, the Jewish man was passed by a priest and Levite of his own faith. Yet he was shown love and care by a Samaritan, an enemy group despised by Jews. 
Jesus highlighted that we are to remember to love all people, even those perceived as enemies or outcasts. 
As we remember the sacrifice of those who died in war this Remembrance Sunday, we must also remember Jesus' call to love our neighbors and enemies alike.

35:18 - 47:57 - Sermon - Remembrance - But what are we to remember?
Today's sermon focuses on remembrance and God's law.
The prophets warned Israel about forgetting God's law.
Leaders were corrupt and exploited people.
Israel and Judah were conquered for disobedience.
Jesus later taught the essence of God's law.
He taught radical love and forgiveness.
Love God and love your neighbor as yourself.
Your neighbor includes your enemies.
Jesus set the example by forgiving his enemies.
We must also love and forgive our enemies and those who wrong us.

Today's sermon centers on the theme of remembrance, specifically calling us to remember God's law. The prophets like Micah warned the people of Israel and Judah not to forget or disobey God's commands. 
Yet they experienced punishment and exile when leaders exploited the people. Jesus later taught the core of God's law is to radically love others, even enemies who wrong you. 
He set the example by forgiving his enemies while dying on the cross. 
As we remember the sacrifice of Jesus this Remembrance Sunday, we are also called to walk in forgiveness and love for our enemies and neighbors.

Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and we

22:47 - Introduction to the readings
27:17 - 28:21 - Readings: Psalm 145. 1 – 10 NIVUK read by Elsje Hatton
28:42 - 31:25 - Hebrews 11. 1 – 10, 12. 1 – 3 NIVUK read by Tony Hatton

31:46 - 34:38 - Hymn TP 13 - Be still for the presence of the Lord

34:48 - 35:28 - Short prayer
35:31 - 46:54 - Short Address: ‘Keep going!’
We live in an age of information overload from social media and news.
The information cloud often contains disturbing news that leaves us feeling battered.
Global tragedies become local when they affect our families and neighbors.
We need stillness and community support to ask where faith fits in.
Faith is lived out through people's lives down the centuries.
Bible heroes like Noah and Moses held onto faith in hard times.
We are part of the story of faith when we rely on God's unseen reality.
The cloud of witnesses encourages us in our current challenges.
Keep focused on Jesus, throw off hindrances, and persevere.
In communion we connect with the faithful worldwide and through time.
Keep going by eliminating whatever trips us up spiritually.
The passage from Hebrews about being surrounded by the great cloud of witnesses provides the image of keeping going, persevering by being encouraged by those who have run the race of faith before us.
Keep walking with Christ no matter what difficulties we face.

We can feel battered by disturbing news. Yet faith has been lived out through the centuries, as shown by biblical heroes who relied on God even in hard times. We are part of this story of faith when we trust God's unseen reality. A cloud of witnesses from the past and present encourage us. The sermon calls us to stay focused on Jesus, removing hindrances and persevering despite difficulties. In communion we connect with faithful people across the world and throughout history.

33:09 - Introduction to the readings
34:39 - 36:34 - Reading Leviticus 19. 1,2, 9 – 18 NIVUK read by Sue Thorne
36:40 - 39:02 - Reading Matthew 22:34-46 (Good News) read by John Hillson

39:46 - 42:18 - Hymn - R&amp;S 745 A new commandment I give to you

42:23 - 59:19 - Address: ‘Love and justice’
Focus on the command to love God and neighbor from Leviticus.
Jesus deepened this command in 4 key ways.
  Jesus linked the command to love your neighbor as yourself with the command to love God with all your heart, soul, and mind. He saw them as two parts of the greatest commandment.
  Expanding &quot;neighbor&quot; to include all people, challenging tribalism. Jesus taught that &quot;neighbor&quot; includes those outside your own community, like the Good Samaritan helping a stranger.
  Demonstrating the depth of love through his life and death. Jesus showed what self-sacrificial, agape love looks like in his ministry, death on the cross, and resurrection.
  Giving the power to love through the Holy Spirit. At Pentecost, Jesus gave the gift of the Holy Spirit to empower his followers to love others as he loved them.
Love is practical - Leviticus gives examples.
Caring for vulnerable, pursuing justice - core themes.
Love and justice needed in conflicts like Israel Palestine.
Exploring Jesus' radical expanding of the command from Leviticus to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Jesus linked loving God fully with loving all neighbors, demonstrated self-sacrificial love, and gave the power of the Spirit to love. Leviticus shows love is practical - caring for vulnerable, pursuing justice. We're called to follow Jesus' example and love all, even enemies, challenging tribalism with God's overflowing love.

01:00:28 - 01:03:58 - Hymn R&amp;S 108 The love of God is broad

01:04:01 - 01:11:06 - Prayers for the church and the world with the response
We thank you for your great love and compassion:
help us to show that love today.

01:11:25 - 01:14:55 - Hymn - R&amp;S 95 God is love

01:14:56 - 01:15:29 - Blessing

38:41 - 01:00:34 - Sermon &quot;It is I; don't be afraid&quot;
followed by a time of quiet reflection
Jesus walks on water to meet the disciples in the storm. This shows his power over nature and the elements.
The story links to the Old Testament accounts of God's deliverance, exceeding Moses. It reveals Jesus' divine identity.
The disciples were obeying Jesus by going across the lake, yet still faced difficulty. Obeying God doesn't prevent troubles.
Jesus reassured the frightened disciples in the storm. He comes alongside us in our difficulties too.
Fear caused the disciples to panic and be influenced by superstition. We must not let fear and imagination misguide us.
Jesus said &quot;It is I, do not be afraid&quot; - echoing God's divine name. His words bring comfort.
To reach safety, the disciples had to invite Jesus into the boat. We need to let Jesus in our lives and trust Him.
Though believers face storms, Jesus offers security. He walked toward the disciples to help them.
The way out of hardship is to let go of fear, respond in faith, and let Jesus lead. He will never let us down.
Jesus gives forgiveness, new life and purpose. He goes with us each day, leading us eternally into God's presence.
This passage reveals Jesus' divine power and identity. Though followers face difficulties, Jesus offers comfort, security and purpose to those who trust Him. We must let go of fear, respond in faith, and let Him lead us through life's storms into the safety of God's presence.
A priest, a vicar and a Baptist minister go fishing together. The priest walks on the water to retrieve something he forgot, then comes back. Later, the vicar does the same. When the Baptist minister tries, he falls into the water. The priest asks the vicar if they should tell the Baptist minister where the stones are that they walked on.

26:57 - 29:44 - HYMN 517 As the bride is to her chosen
[Tune: Bridegroom]

29:50 - 43:02 - Address - Wisdom and generosity.
The readings are from Proverbs and Mark's Gospel about wisdom and generosity in daily life.
These themes are universal and apply to all humanity.
Proverbs was written to help Jews returning from exile reapply God's teachings.
Proverbs encourages following the Ten Commandments, trusting God, and turning from evil.
Wisdom is praised as more valuable than material riches.
In Mark's Gospel, Jesus meets a rich young man interested in following him.
Jesus tells the man to sell possessions and give the money to the poor.
The man is grieved because he can't let go of his possessions.
We who are rich must be generous and care for others.
Here is a paragraph for sermon notes:

The universal themes of wisdom and generosity from ancient Jewish texts apply to us today. Though wealthy, we must use wisdom in following God's laws and practice generosity through charity. We should care for others, especially the poor and those with challenges. This sermon calls us to examine our priorities and attachments that may limit generosity. Will we, like the rich young man, cling to possessions? Or will we joyfully share our riches with compassion?

Proverbs contains wise sayings, some dating back before 900 BC to King Solomon's time.
The later reflective passages in Proverbs were written around 520 BC when the Temple was rebuilt in Jerusalem after the Jews returned from exile in Babylon.
These passages were meant to help the returning Jews remember and reapply God's teachings and the Ten Commandments after being away for two generations.
Mark's Gospel was written around 30 years after Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection.
The story takes place around 25 AD as Jesus travels from Caesarea Philippi to Capernaum with his disciples.
Jesus had ministry in the Holy Land, also known as Israel/Palestine, the area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
The Jews had been absent from the Holy Land for about 450 years until the exodus from Egypt led by Moses.
This sermon connects the ancient wisdom from Proverbs to Jesus' teachings, showing continuity in Jewish thought across different historical periods.
