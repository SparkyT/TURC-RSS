Introduction to Bible readings
We will now listen to our readings read by John Hillson and Lesley Bogart.

Readings 

Psalm 139 read by John Hillson (seated) 

John 9:1-11 read by Lesley Bogart
1 As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 His disciples asked him, ‘Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’
3 ‘Neither this man nor his parents sinned,’ said Jesus, ‘but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him. 4 As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work. 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.’
6 After saying this, he spat on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. 7 ‘Go,’ he told him, ‘wash in the Pool of Siloam’ (this word means ‘Sent’). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.
8 His neighbours and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, ‘Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?’ 9 Some claimed that he was.
Others said, ‘No, he only looks like him.’
But he himself insisted, ‘I am the man.’
10 ‘How then were your eyes opened?’ they asked.
11 He replied, ‘The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.’

16:08 - Opening Prayer and The Lord’s Prayer

19:50 - Introduction to the theme: Saying Thank You
I have in mind a story from the Gospel
Do you remember the story where Jesus met 10 lepers on the road
They didn't come near but said to him - &quot;Master, have pity on us&quot;
He told them to go to the priest and they would be cleansed
There are 200,000 people suffering with leprosy in 2020
It can be cured now but there is still a lot of it around
These 10 men did not have access to modern medicine, they would have gone to a colony, gradually lost the use of their extremities.
However, they did as told, went to the priest and were seen as cured.
Only one of them turned back to Jesus to thank him
Do we always remember to say thank you?

15:49 - Welcome and lighting of the peace candle

17:32 - United Reformed Church 50th anniversary memorabilia 
19:49 - Call to worship
With the whole Christian Church, the United Reformed Church believes in one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
Glory to God in highest heaven:  peace to all people on earth.

20:10 - Hymn -  R&amp;S 29  Father we love you

21:33 - The life of faith to which we are called is the Spirit’s gift continually received through the Word, the Sacraments and our Christian life together:
Glory to God in highest heaven; 
peace to all people on earth.

22:08 - Opening Prayers 

23:58 - 29:00 - Introduction for all ages – joined together
I would have loved to give each of you a piece of this 50th anniversary jigsaw but there is nothing more annoying than a missing piece
What kind of piece would you be? Corner, curly, straight?
I was sent a single piece this week, sent to URC ministers
Every time you reach 35 years in the URC ministry, you receive a symbolic piece to show how you are part of the one church family
Coming together as one family, united in peace, joining pieces together.
When we take the small piece of bread, it reminds us we are all a part of the one body of Christ, building to make one huge picture together
As reminders we have cards showing Faith, Hope, and Love with 4 questions for each day
How have I acted with love today?
How have I lived the life of Jesus today?
How have I lived my faith today?
How have I walked with hope today?

29:23 - 29:52 - Reading: Psalm 133 (Good News) 
133 How wonderful it is, how pleasant,
    for God's people to live together in harmony!
2 It is like the precious anointing oil
    running down from Aaron's head and beard,
    down to the collar of his robes.
3 It is like the dew on Mount Hermon,
    falling on the hills of Zion.
That is where the Lord has promised his blessing—
    life that never ends.

30:42 - 31:30 - Trinity Vision: Small Groups 

31:54 - 34:12 - Trinity Vision: Midweek Café

34:20 - Songs R&amp;S 565  Jesus stand among us
    TP 4  All heaven declares

40:33 - Introducing the readings
The highest authority for what we believe and do is God’s Word in the Bible alive for his people today through the help of the Spirit.
Glory to God in highest heaven; 
peace to all people on earth.

41:13 - 42:07 - Reading: 1 Corinthians 12. 1 – 5, 12 – 13, 31 (NIVUK) 
42:33 - Reaction to the reading

43:37 - Held together in the Body of Christ through the freedom of the Spirit, we rejoice in the diversity of the Spirit’s gifts and uphold the rights of personal conviction. For the sake of faith and fellowship it shall be for the church to decide where differences of conviction hurt our unity and peace.
Glory to God in highest heaven; 
peace to all people on earth.

42:10 - A Prayer of the unity and peace in the church family

45:35 - 47:30 - Reading: 1 Corinthians 13. 1 – 13 (NIVUK) 

48:28 - Hymn - R&amp;S 354 Come, Living God, when least expected

51:53 - 01:01:43 - Short Talk: ‘Faith, hope and love NOW’
Are you among the ardent youth or the mellow age?
Most of us rather mellow
Thinking of our anniversary, I tried to remember what it was like being 50
I remember being 40 more than 50
I was given an axe for my 50th birthday - in a pub!
What is it like being 50
In the history of the Church, 50 is nothing really, even less in the history of humanity, it's just a blink of an eye
Faith, Hope, Love since 1972 for the URC
Paul's 1st letter to the Corinthians Ch 13. A difficult letter he was writing
Replace the word &quot;love&quot; with &quot;Jesus&quot; to understand more
Paul longs for people to reflect that love in their lives
We believe in a loving God, not a condemning God
We have many convictions, expressed in different ways yet we hold that common faith in a loving God and Jesus
There are three things that last forever - faith, hope, and love and the greatest of these is love - hold on to that

01:01:49 - We affirm our intention to go on praying and working, with all our fellow Christians, for the visible unity of the Church in the way Christ chooses, so that people and nations may be led to love and serve God and praise him more and more, for ever.
Glory to God in highest heaven; 
peace to all people on earth.

01:02:47 - 01:04:50 - Prayers for the church and the world

01:04:55 - Hymn - R&amp;S 469  As we are gathered Jesus is here

01:07:33 - Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at church (or at home) united in the name of Jesus Christ

01:07:33 - A Prayer of thanksgiving and Lord’s Prayer 

01:10:52 - 01:17:23 - Distribution of Communion and Closing Prayer

01:17:24 - Hymn - R&amp;S 603  Lord for the years

01:21:18 - 01:21:50 - Blessing

20:16 - Opening Prayer of thanksgiving 

22:17 - 28:04 - Introduction: ‘harvest links’
The harvest display connects us with people across the country and across the world
Sunflower oil and sunflowers to creation and Ukraine
An ear of wheat - gleaning the leftovers after harvest from the field behind Cores End church - farmers everywhere
A coin - connecting to the Queen, thinking of the late Queen Elizabeth II and her family
An envelope - connecting us with the people in Africa experiencing a vicious drought, supported by Christian Aid

42:51 - Song - Our God is a great big God

44:57 - Short Christian Aid Film: the Crisis in East Africa

47:56 - Prayer for East Africa
Loving and compassionate God, 
When Famine stalks the land, nothing grows. 
Plants cannot, people cannot, ideas and dreams cannot  
everything withers and dies. 
It is a violent aberration of your will for the world 
and it is multiplied now by conflict, climate change and covid. 
God of the flourishing field, there is enough to feed us all. 
Call us to that sacred sharing, neighbour to global neighbour,  
your gifts of food, water, a chance to live the life 
so delicately crafted by your divine spirit. 
We will not turn away but turn towards each other 
with generosity and a justice-driven compassion 
that searches for solutions. 
Famine stalks the land, so may our outrage grow, 
may our determination steel itself, 
may our solidarity spur us into action. 
God of the flourishing field, help us feed each other.  Amen.

50:26 - Song - Come all you people, come and praise your maker (video)
Uyai mose, tinamate mwari. (x3)
Uyai mose zvino.

Activity for children at back of church

52:45 - 54:05 - Reading: Luke 12 8.1 – 9 
13 Someone in the crowd said to him, ‘Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.’
14 Jesus replied, ‘Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?’ 15 Then he said to them, ‘Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.’
16 And he told them this parable: ‘The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 He thought to himself, “What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.”
18 ‘Then he said, “This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I’ll say to myself, ‘You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.’”
20 ‘But God said to him, “You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?”
21 ‘This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich towards God.’

54:42 - Song - Give thanks with a grateful heart (MP 170)

57:42 - 01:06:30 - Short Talk
We live connected lives
Our display connects us with many people - rich and poor, black and white, friends and enemies
Many situations linked to us, we can not live in a vacuum
The rich man in the parable tries this, no concern for his workers, just what to do with all his wealth - go for growth, growth, growth
It could be a parable of the western world
Jesus said to be on guard for all kinds of greed
Life does not consist of an abundance of possessions
Reflecting on the life of our Queen, we could say she was one of the top 0.1% in terms of wealth but looking at her lifetime of service, what she has done is incredible.  &quot;Each day is a new beginning, I know that the only way to live my life is to try to do what is right&quot; 
Jesus said - whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich towards God
Let's speak to God today, come clean, and be challenged to live our lives better putting our trust in Our loving Saviour

01:06:32 - Hymn - God whose farm is all creation (R&amp;S 612)

16:48 - Call to worship:

18:18 - Hymn - Our God our help in ages past R&amp;S 705

21:51 - Opening Prayer

24:07 - The Lord’s Prayer

25:20 - 27:17 - Reading: Luke 15 vv 1-10  read by Norma
Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering round to hear Jesus. 2 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, ‘This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.’
3 Then Jesus told them this parable: 4 ‘Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says, “Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.” 7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent.
The parable of the lost coin
8 ‘Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins[a] and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? 9 And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbours together and says, “Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.” 10 In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.’

27:30 - 30:52 - Talk for All ages
I remember the chaplain coming to my last place of work
Misunderstanding the chaplain referring to us as a flock of sheep
Driving home from Wales one night and a sheep ran out into the side of the road.
God loves all of us and doesn't want any one of us to be lost
Lots of things make us wander off from God
Everyday life, tragedies etc.
We can help by doing something that sheep do a lot - bleat, which for us translates to praying
Remember the God forgives when we return to him and ask for forgiveness

30:54 - Hymn: Brother sister let me serve you R&amp;S 474 

34:28 - 36:07 - Reading: 1 Timothy 1  vv 12-17 read  by Alan
2 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. 13 Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 14 The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
15 Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners – of whom I am the worst. 16 But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

36:17 - Hymn: The King of love my shepherd is  R&amp;S 552 

39:46 - 49:32 - Sermon followed by time of quite reflection
We heard two parables today, the lost sheep and the lost coin
Different but vividly illustrating the truth of John 3:16 - God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
Both follow the same pattern:
1. Something is lost
2. There is a search for the thing that is lost
3. There is great joy when the thing that is lost is found
How the things are lost are not important to the parables
The items are regarded as precious by their owner, just as we are regarded by God
Jesus is the shepherd not content to be happy with the 99, he will go out and look for the missing one
God so loved us that whilst we were still sinners, he gave His Son
We need a daily awareness of the gospel in our lives to keep us humble before our Saviour
Do we look down on the sinners around us or do we seek the sinners as the lost needing to be found?

51:18 - Hymn: Eternal Father of the ceaseless round R&amp;S 623

56:08 - Prayers of Intercession

01:00:35 - Hymn: God is love let heaven adore Him R&amp;S 95

09:35 - Call to worship: from Psalm 33
The world belongs to the Lord,
the earth and all its creatures.
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord;
how good it is, to sing praises to our God.

10:24 - Hymn - R&amp;S 45  Morning has broken

12:20 - Opening Prayer 

13:34 - Introduction to Season of Creation for all ages: ‘Listen up!’
September sees the beginning of the season of creation
Celebrated across the world by people from all kinds of backgrounds
Christians in Pakistan suffering from floods 
Christians in East Africa suffering the worst drought in years
Christians in Germany meeting at the council of World Churches
Christians in Ukraine suffering from the invasion by Russia
The season begins on the 1st September and continues to the 4th October, St Francis's Day
This sense of relationship to the whole natural order goes back to the bible, one of the great Psalms speaks of creation which we will use now

15:53 - 17:35 - Reading: Psalm 19 
The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of God’s hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. 
Listen to creation tell of God, listen to God’s Word today 
They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. 
Listen to creation tell of God, listen to God’s Word today
 The law of the LORD is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple. The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. 
Listen to creation tell of God, listen to God’s Word today 
The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes. The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The decrees of the LORD are firm, and all of them are righteous. 
Listen to creation tell of God, listen to God’s Word today

17:35 - 18:04 - Listening is the theme of this year's season of Creation

39:50 - 41:15 - Reading: Mark 4:1-9 (Good News) read by Lesley Bogart

41:31 - 53:02 - Short Address: ‘Listen’
Geese flying over the house honking
Energy and the cost of living crisis leading to lots of honking from politicians at the moment
A call to listen is at the heart of our worship today
To listen to the world around us and to God's voice
Wordplay from Jesus in the parable &quot;If you have ears, listen&quot;
The natural world is sending strong messages to us as the human race - wake up, protect from damage, turn back from the climate crisis
Climate change first shown to be happening in 1939 but the message was delayed due to other events that year
We have to listen to each other, the world, and God
We have to protect His creation and liberating his people
May we listen and may we act in Jesus' name


53:04 - Profession of Faith 
We believe in God, the Source of all life, who creates all things, who embraces all things, who celebrates all things, who is present in every part of the fabric of creation, who is and baptises this planet with living water. 
We believe in Jesus Christ, the Seed of new life, who loves and cares for this world and who suffers with it and for it and came to reconcile and renew this world and everything in it. 
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Breath of God, who moves among and with us today. 
We believe in everlasting life in God, the living hope that one day God will put an end to death and all destructive forces.
To the Living God, Trinity of Love, be all praise and glory, now and for evermore.  Amen.
(Gurukul Theological college, India - adapted)

20:55 - 27:33 - Introduction for all ages; ‘Awesome!’
What comes into your mind when you hear the word &quot;awesome&quot;? Teenagers maybe?
It's a word for us all
What do you find awesome? Or is the world so jaded we have lost our sense of awe?
Sunsets, nature, God, Tour de France riders
Awesome people: Skydivers, wheelchair racers at the Commonwealth Games, Malala Yousafzai
Awesome nature: Sunrise, sunset, mountains and lakes, giant redwoods, murmurations of starlings
Awesome universe: pictures from the James Webb telescope
Behind our awesome creation is the awesome reality we call God
God created all things, worthy of our worship

27:35 - Songs:
MP 1005 Our God is an awesome God
MP 242 Hosanna, hosanna

32:21 - Introducing the readings

33:45 - 34:30 - Reading: Psalm 103.1-8 NIVUK 
1  Praise the LORD, my soul;
    all my inmost being, praise his holy name.
2  Praise the LORD, my soul,
    and forget not all his benefits –
3  who forgives all your sins
    and heals all your diseases,
4  who redeems your life from the pit
    and crowns you with love and compassion,
5  who satisfies your desires with good things
    so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
6  The LORD works righteousness
    and justice for all the oppressed.
7  He made known his ways to Moses,
    his deeds to the people of Israel:
8  the LORD is compassionate and gracious,
    slow to anger, abounding in love.

34:38 - 36:47 - Reading: Hebrews 12. 49 – 56
18  You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that
is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;  19  to a trumpet
blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it
begged that no further word be spoken to them,  20  because they
could not bear what was commanded: ‘If even an animal touches
the mountain, it must be stoned to death.’  21  The sight was so
terrifying that Moses said, ‘I am trembling with fear.’
22  But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God,
the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon
thousands of angels in joyful assembly,  23  to the church of the
firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to
God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made
perfect,  24  to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the
sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
25  See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not
escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how
much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from
heaven?  26  At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has
promised, ‘Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the
heavens.’  27  The words ‘once more’ indicate the removing of what
can be shaken – that is, created things – so that what cannot be
shaken may remain.

28  Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be
shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with
reverence and awe,  29  for our ‘God is a consuming fire.’

37:05 - Hymn MP 50 - Be still for the presence of the Lord

41:03 - 53:28 - Address
What have we come to as we sit here or watch from home?
A building where people have gathered Sunday by Sunday for 122 years - almost 9000 Sundays!
A place where the service is uplifting, the music empowering, the preacher engaging?
A group of people yes, but also this awesome God
Political leaders come and go, wealth fades, athletic prowess diminishes, the world changes but at the heart of life, the one, unchanging God
The one revealed to Moses - &quot;I am who I am&quot;, the great &quot;I am&quot;
The giving of the law on Mount Sinai was an awesome moment
The writer to the Hebrews talks of Moses trembling in fear
The Old Testament speaks again and again of fear of God being the beginning of all wisdom
This God alone is worthy of worship
The consuming fire of love, the light that blazes and drives away corruption, wipes away hatred &amp; selfishness
This is the worship God accepts today. Worship that flows into action, driving how we live day to day
Let us take a moment to offer wonder, love, and praise to our awesome God.

19:00 - Opening Prayers and Lord’s Prayer

23:31 - 27:07 - Introduction for all ages
How many of you have one of these - an Apostle Spoon?
Whenever we visited an Aunt in childhood, a set of these would come out to look at
I bought a set of 6 many years ago, all but one disappeared now
They were originally given as gifts at the time of baptism as a symbol the person was a follower of Jesus or the hope that the child would become one
Made of solid silver but likely not any more
It reminds us that God is always close to hand if we follow Jesus

27:09 - Song MP 225 He’s got the whole wide world in His hands

29:12 - Introducing the readings

30:17 - Reading: Jeremiah 23. 23 – 29 NIVUK 
‘Am I only a God nearby,’ declares the LORD,
‘and not a God far away?
24  Who can hide in secret places
so that I cannot see them?’ declares the LORD.
 ‘Do not I fill heaven and earth?’ declares the LORD.
25  ‘I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my
name. They say, “I had a dream! I had a dream!”  26  How long will
this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy
the delusions of their own minds?  27  They think the dreams they
tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their
ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship.  28  Let the prophet
who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my

word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?’
declares the LORD.  29  ‘Is not my word like fire,’ declares the LORD,
‘and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?

31:40 - 32:55 - Reading: Luke 12. 49 – 56 
49  ‘I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were
already kindled!  50  But I have a baptism to undergo, and what
constraint I am under until it is completed!  51  Do you think I came
to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.  52  From now on
there will be five in one family divided against each other, three
against two and two against three.  53  They will be divided, father
against son and son against father, mother against daughter and
daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law
and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.’
54  He said to the crowd: ‘When you see a cloud rising in the west,
immediately you say, “It’s going to rain,” and it does.  55  And when
the south wind blows, you say, “It’s going to be hot,” and it
is.  56  Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the
earth and the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret
this present time?

33:09 - Hymn R&amp;S 317 Lord thy word, abideth

36:25 - 52:28 - Address
When have you had to face something you didn't like but knew was going to happen
Not knowing when or why, what were your emotions
This is what Jesus was feeling in the gospel reading from Luke 12
He doesn't welcome the idea of what will happen in Jerusalem but accepts it
Jeremiah says many people claim to speak from God but are false prophets
He says the community is awash with false information about God
Nowadays we hear a lot about fake news
Today in our lifetimes, the truth about God is often hidden 
God's word is a word of judgement that Jesus brings
Jeremiah says God's word is like a fire
What is God really like?
When our emotions are stirred, are they stirred by God or those around us?

Silent reflection

11:01 - Call to worship (based on Hebrews 10)
Let us come near to God with open hearts,
for Jesus has opened for us a new and living way.
Let us hold on firmly to the hope we profess,
because we can trust God to keep his promise. 
Let us be concerned for one another,
helping one another to show love and do good.
Let us come together and encourage each other,
more and more, as we follow Jesus here and now.


12:30 - Hymn - R&amp;S 102 Praise the Lord, his glories show

15:42 - Opening Prayers with responses
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.
Christ have mercy: Christ have mercy.
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.

19:08 - 27:30 - Introduction: a word from Lighthouse
What is Lighthouse?
When is it?
Where is it held?
Who is involved?
What do we do?
How can you help?

28:00 - Lighthouse Song (video)

32:43 - 34:18 - Reading: Psalm 98 NIVUK 

Sing to the LORD a new song,
    for he has done marvelous things;
his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
2  The LORD has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
3  He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel;
all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
4  Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music;
5  make music to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing,
6  with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn – shout for joy before the LORD, the King.
7  Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.
8  Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy;
9  let them sing before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.
He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.

36:31 - 38:24 - Reading: Hebrews 1. 1 – 8 NIVUK 
1 In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many
times and in various ways,  2  but in these last days he has spoken to us by
his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also
he made the universe.  3  The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the
exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful
word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the
right hand of the Majesty in heaven.  4  So he became as much superior to
the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
5  For to which of the angels did God ever say,
‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father’?
Or again, ‘I will be his Father,  and he will be my Son’?
6  And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says,
‘Let all God’s angels worship him.’
7  In speaking of the angels he says,

38:50 - 47:00 - Introducing the letter to the Hebrews (video)
47:04 - 47:57 - Summary of the reading and letter to the Hebrews

47:59 - Song: R&amp;S 271 You are the king of glory

50:42 - Prayer

51:10 - 52:07 - Reading Hebrews 4.14 – 16 NIVUK
14  Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into
heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we
profess.  15  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to feel
sympathy for our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted
in every way, just as we are – yet he did not sin.  16  Let us then approach
God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy
and find grace to help us in our time of need.

52:10 - 01:00:39 - Talk: ‘Hold on!’
&quot;Grace to help us in our time of need&quot;
As we look at the world right now, we see a time of great need
The Ukraine, China, Taiwan, The Other Western Nations, The Climate Emergency, Environmental Need, Displacement due to conflict, the refugee crisis, doubt in the democratic process as our government attempts to regain trust and integrity, the cost of living crisis: surely this is a time of need
But centuries ago these Jewish Christians, different to us in language, understandings, lifestyles. Think of their lives burdened by absolute poverty, unsure what persecution would arise in the brutal Roman Empire.  They were in a time of need.
Some questioned whether their faith was enough, some were slipping away
The writer challenges them to hold on to the precious gift of Jesus given to them
He was tempted but held on to his god even when all had deserted him
Draw close the writer says, don't turn back, hold fast and come with confidence to your saviour
Let the radiance of God's glory shine bright in your dark place and in the dark places of our world 

01:00:50 - Offering Prayer (of all our gifts – no collection is taken up)

01:01:41 - Song R&amp;S 375 In my life, Lord, be glorified

01:03:41 - Prayers for the church and the world with the response:
Great God, in your mercy
hear our prayer.

08:57 - Call to worship (from Hebrews 13)

God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’  
So we say with confidence,
‘The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. 
What can mere mortals do to me?
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.
Therefore, through Jesus, let us continually offer to God 
a sacrifice of praise and not forget to do good

 your love endures for ever.

15:10 - 24:12 - Introduction: ‘Time!’
We make it or waste it
Where has the year gone?
Coming in 2 minutes early
Time to stay for refreshments afterwards
Watching the clock too much?
Images from the James Webb telescope, seeing images from things that happened thousands of years ago in the Southern Ring Nebula
8 minute for light from the sun to reach us
Do you have time?
Special thanks in this jubilee year for the URC, 50 years since the formation?

Think about 3 events to put on the timeline: a personal one, a special moment in the church, and an event in the community, nation or world

41:30 - Worship song: MP 1259  Bless the Lord o my soul

45:44 - Introduction to reading

46:16 - 47:35 - Reading: Luke 4.14 – 21 (The Message) 

47:47 - 52:42 - All age talk: ‘The Time is now!’
What a moment that must have been - that synagogue where Jesus read the words from Isaiah saying what he was about
For the United Reformed Church, this is seen as a jubilee year, when we want God's time to shine
Anniversary socks from the URC Ministers' gathering
What else can you buy that's URC branded - soap!
Jesus gives his agenda in the moment in Galilee - a very particular place and moment
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me - to bring good news to the poor
God's time is now
Good news can't just be words, it has to be actions
The story ends with Jesus being turned out and a crowd attempting to stone him
Moments of jubilation and despair on our timeline
Is God shining through Jesus and hist followers
We need to open our eyes to find where that light is shining in unexpected places


54:58 - Song: MP 545  Open my eyes Lord

55:55 - Short talk: Vision for Trinity 
Key themes from the planning group - worship and Christian discipleship
Outward looking, communicating the good news of Jesus
Focusing on the resources we have - buildings, finance and people
Working in partnership
Start small - crawl, walk, then run
Doing something, not remaining paralysed

Offering Prayer (of all our gifts – no collection is taken up)

59:08 - 01:00:11 - Song Open my hands Lord
Open our hands, Lord,
we want to serve Jesus,
to reach out in his name,
and show his love for all.
Open our hearts, Lord,
and help us to follow.
Open our hands, Lord,
we want to serve Jesus.

Your kingdom come
  Your will be done.

22:40 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

25:15 - 34:07 - Talk for all ages: “Teach us to pray”
We are glad it's not as hot as last Monday and Tuesday
When it's that hot, it's hard to even think, one just wants to be still and get through it
Think about a time when you had to learn a skill
Sometimes the learning is successful, sometimes not
Learning to tie shoelaces?
Learning to play the piano?
Learning to drive?
In the reading from Luke's gospel, the disciples want Jesus to teach them how to pray.
In Luke more than others, we hear of when Jesus is praying
We have already used the prayer he taught them all two thousand years ago
There is so much in the Lord's Prayer
What he taught them was not what they were expecting which was something long and wordy
What Jesus taught was a simple prayer, the short version of this can be said just in one breath
If ever you are uncertain of how to pray, the Lord's Prayer is a great place to start

34:22 - Hymn - Father I place into your hands (R&amp;S 518)

34:50 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:
Adults: May the Lord be with you
Junior Church: And also with you
All: Amen.

37:53 - Introduction to Bible readings

38:23 - Reading: Luke 11. 1 – 13 NIVUK
11 One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one
of his disciples said to him, ‘Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his
disciples.’
2  He said to them, ‘When you pray, say:
‘“Father,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come.
3  Give us each day our daily bread.
4  Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.
And lead us not into temptation.”’
5  Then Jesus said to them, ‘Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him
at midnight and say, “Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;  6  a friend of
mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer
him.”  7  And suppose the one inside answers, “Don’t bother me. The door
is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and
give you anything.”  8  I tell you, even though he will not get up and give
you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless
audacity ]  he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.
9  ‘So I say to you: ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find;
knock and the door will be opened to you.  10  For everyone who asks
receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door
will be opened.
11  ‘Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake
instead?  12  Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?  13  If you then,
though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who
ask him!’

40:35 - 42:43 - Reading: Colossians 2. 6 – 15 NIVUK 


43:03 - Hymn - I will sing the wondrous story (CMP 315)

46:52 - Prayer
47:46 - 01:05:06 - Sermon: “Ask and you will receive”
These familiar words are used just after the Disciples ask Jesus to teach them how to pray 
They highlight how important it is for us to ask, seek, knock and pray
Why do some people say prayer is irrelevant
Looking at prayer in the context of our relationship with God
Finally thinking about the nature of God that sets the words in context
Distinguishing between gifts from God as creator and father - creation and redemption

A time of quiet reflection

01:06:00 - Hymn - What a friend we have in Jesus (R&amp;S 413)

01:08:56 - Prayers for others and ourselves
Offering Prayer of all our gifts – no collection is taken up

01:15:18 - Hymn - At the name of Jesus (R&amp;S 261)

01:18:34 - 01:18:54 - Closing blessing / the Grace

12:18 - Call to worship

13:47 - Hymn: R&amp;S 45 Morning has broken [Tune: Bunessan]

15:59 - Opening Prayers 
Lord’s Prayer 

18:54 - 23:40 - Talk with all ages - Prophets
Our first reading will be from one of the Old Testament Prophets
Do any of our young people understand what prophets
One that prophesies, something where you spend money to make more money
Homophones and prophets/profits
We all profit from the wisdom of the prophets
Prophets weren't actually telling the future, their job was to tell it like it is
Speaking truth to power and telling those in power that things were not going as they should be
Thinking of modern day prophets
Greta Thunberg - a schoolgirl but understands the world as it is today is not going to be able to sustain itself unless we change.

23:55 - Song TP 13  Be still, for the presence of the Lord   

27:05 - Offering Prayer (of all our gifts – no collection is taken up)

Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:
Adults:   The Lord be with you
Junior Church:  And also with you
All:      Amen.

29:10 - Introduction to the readings
  
30:21 - Reading: Amos 7:7-17 NIVUK 


33:32 - 35:35 - Reading: Colossians 1: 1 – 14 NIVUK 

35:45 - Song: TP 13   God forgave my sin

38:31 - 50:48 - Address: How to live a good life which honors God
The two bible readings could hardly be more different
Separated in time by about 800 years, the tone of the two is markedly different
Amos wrote his prophecy in around 760BC some 20 years before the better known Isiah
Amos didn't see himself as a prophet, not employed by anyone important, he worked the land.
He traveled widely and knew the northern kingdom well.
He saw lots of inequality and divisions in society
Merchants were paying lip service only to their religion
The Altar at Bethel was being used to worship false Gods
When he challenged the High Priest, Amos was told to go back to Judah
Amos warned that Israel's exile to Assyria was at had but was ignored
There are sad parallels with our society today
Our Prime Minister Boris Johnson wriggling out of one scandal after another. Now irretrievably rejected by his MPs he has accepted he needs to go but is still clinging to power. Brought down by his own dishonest.
Think of Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the war crimes committed there.
Think of the riots in Sri Lanka
Think of the earthquake in Afghanistan and all of the other issues there
Paul's letter to the Colossians is in contrast to this.
Written from house arrest in Rome whilst waiting for false accusations to be dealt with.
It is full of hope, written to stem the influence of teaching aimed at trapping the people in superstition
We are still Paul's congregation
We have been rescued by God through Christ Jesus, forgiving our sins.
Paul's message helps us to bear in mind that God in Christ Jesus is all in all, first and last, head of the Church, all powerful and generous in return for our faith and obedience to God's law - loving him with all our strength, soul, and mind and to love our neighbour as we love ourself


51:04 - Hymn R&amp;S 613 Lord, speak to me [Tune: RS 50; Galilee]

54:41 - Prayers of intercession with the response
Leader: The Lord hears our prayer:
All:  Thanks be to God.

Slowly breathe in and out feeling the air moving
Difficulty living with asthma
The breathing of the church

Living our christian and human lives day by day
Keeping in balance
Jesus trusting the disciples with his work
Using the words &quot;Peace to this house&quot;
