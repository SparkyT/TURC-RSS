HYMN We sing a love that sets all people free TUNE R&amp;S 740
WOODLANDS
We sing a love that sets all people free,
that blows like wind, that burns like scorching flame,
enfolds the earth, springs up like water clear:
come, living love, live in our hearts today.

We sing a love that seeks another’s good,
that longs to serve and not to count the cost,
a love that, yielding, finds itself made new:
come, caring love, live in our hearts today.
We sing a love, unflinching, unafraid
to be itself, despite another’s wrath,
a love that stands alone and undismayed:
come, strengthening love, live in our hearts today.
We sing a love that, wandering, will not rest
until it finds its way, its home, its source,
through joy and sadness pressing on refreshed:
come, pilgrim love, live in our hearts today.
We sing the Holy Spirit, full of love,
who seeks out scars of ancient bitterness,
brings to our wounds the healing grace of Christ:
come, radiant love, live in our hearts today.

19:27 - Hymn R&amp;S 262  Crown him with many crowns

23:38 - Opening Prayers
25:18 - Lord’s Prayer

25:57 - 34:39 - Introduction: ‘Love Wycombe?’ 
I hope you have all heard of Love Wycombe by now
Part of the life of churches in Wycombe for over a decade now
This year by the Guildhall on 12th June
As we pray for the Wycombe area, work for its good and prepare to celebrate God’s love for all, let’s ask two questions:
    What do you three things like about your community?
   What three improvements would you like to see happen?


34:46 - 34:38 -  Reading: Psalm 122 read by Kate Yates
36:16 - Peace be with you

36:18 - Song MP 1079  Jesus hope of the nations 
Brian Doerkensen - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsFIGSOTsVM

40:55  - Introduction to reading

41:09 - 42:22 - Reading: Luke 24. 44 – 53 read by Kate Yates

42:53 - Song R&amp;S 264 He is Lord (sung seated as a prayer)

45:42 - 57:45 - Talk:  ‘Mountain top and city streets’
This Sunday is fascinating - is it Easter or something else
It's called different things depending on which lectionary you use
Jesus has died and risen but the holy spirit has not yet arrived. 10 days of waiting.
Is Jesus still with them or has he gone?
Luke describes the ascension in the most literal terms of the 4 gospels
Jesus ascending to heaven wasn't an Apollo/Elon Musk trip to space
There was a transition as Jesus left the physical space and became the greater reality no longer restricted by flesh and blood, opening the disciples' minds
Opening minds - the most important thing for us as Christians today?
Getting caught up in all of our transitions, turning back again and again to the living Jesus who opens our minds to understand the scriptures anew


57:48 - Hymn R&amp;S 579 Lord thy church on earth

01:01:28 - ‘Thy Kingdom come’: Global Wave of Prayer
 LOVE THE WORLD 
God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life…God sent him not to condemn the world …but to save the world.
John 3.16, 17

Prayers for the church and the world with the response:
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done.

 LOVE WYCOMBE TODAY 
Today as we pick up litter in the neighbourhood.
Today as we pray for our neighbours (street by street in ‘Prayer walking’).
Today as we pray for the central event planned for Sunday 12 June

01:10:09 - Hymn -  R&amp;S 603  Lord for the years

01:13:54 -1:14:24 - Blessing.

37:36 - Hymn: R&amp;S 302 O breath of life come sweeping through us

39:46 - 53:12 - Sermon  followed by time of silent reflection
How we go on holiday - planning and investigation
Paul and Timothy had traveled through many places, the only thing stopping them was the work of the Holy Spirit
Called to help a man whilst in Troas leading to a journey that ended up in Phillipi
No real maps, not a carefree journey.  They had been warned off certain places
Taking risks as missionaries
For people of faith, it's God who sets direction and walks with us
Macedonia then and now
God's spirit moves us when God desires
God hears all and is omnipresent
Should we set off and see what happens to us as part of God's plan

52:37 - Hymn: R&amp;S 59 God moves in mysterious ways

18:04 - Opening Prayer
20:12 - Lord’s Prayer

21:12 - Reading - Psalm 1 (Good News version)

22:08 - 25:55 - Short talk: ‘Well-watered trees’
If only life were as simple as the psalm suggests
We know there are great contrasts between good and evil
We are a bit of a mixture, sometimes selfish, sometimes calm and compassionate
Psalms often paint things in stark contrast and we have to be careful not to be too arrogant
We have to try to be the well watered trees with long roots pulling up the nutrients
Think of a tree you are familiar with - near here, in your garden, in a nearby park
What if it is suddenly cut down? How would you feel?
We want to be a well watered tree - for us the water is the spirit of God.
Enabling us to fruit with the gifts of the spirit - love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self control.

26:05 - Song Thuma mina (song from South Africa) unaccompanied

43:21 - Reading: Revelation 21.1-6, 22.1-3 NIVUK

46:02 - 55:20 - Short Talk – God’s renewing of our world
What do you think of that reading?
A fantastic book by John with amazing poetry and fantastic visual
For the Israelites, the sea was something filled with disorder and chaos
In John's imagination we see a river bringing life and causing deserts to bloom
Thinking of Janet with her seed and barrel of water to bring life 
Walking the Thames path
Still a polluted river but a lot less than in the previous centrury
Think of a pure river, wherever it goes, trees grow.
In this vision, the tree grew on both sides of the bank
The tree of life is everywhere the river goes
Beating swords into plowshares
A vision of new life
Miracles - the UK coming second in Eurovision
Praying Ukraine can get to peace and host the next contest
Love Wycombe
Prayer station

20:23 - Reading: John 10. 22 – 30 NIVUK 

21:40 - 24:50 - Talk for all ages
Having to read a lot of CQC reports about various care homes
You can see where people have done things better or worse than you
Under the heading of care it often states that the residents are appropriately dressed - strange at first sight but actually is a good indication of care.
Pulled up one time for a resident wearing a combination of garish clothes
Humans are good at making their own minds up and working things out.
People going to Jesus and asking whether he was the Messiah
Jesus showing people in lots of ways how he loved them and cared for them
Perhaps we need to look for Jesus in all things and follow the signs.

25:00 - Hymn MP 1008 The Lord’s my shepherd (Townsend version)

28:27 - 30:21 - Reading: Acts 9. 36 - 43 NIVUK 

30:24 - Hymn R&amp;S 277 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

33:33 - 49:40 - Address
The reputation of sheep for not being the brightest in the world
Christians getting annoyed when compared to sheep
Sheep seeking security of the flock and following the shepherd
Knowing their shepherd
Needing a leader, someone to guide them
We are like that, needing Jesus
Jesus provides the security of an eternal kingdom
Christianity is not about Christians behaving themselves, it's about hope for those who have none
That's us - filled with doubt and fear, having to cut through uncertainty and ambiguity to belief
Terry Kelly - songwriter from Nova Scotia - In my Father's House
When we are with God, he provides the sanctuary from life's storms, all we have to do is come inside with faith

46:17 - Hymn R&amp;S Christ is alive

48:58 - 01:00:25 - Short Address
Christ is alive, no longer bound to years in Palestine
Today we have heard how the risen Jesus touched the lives of Peter and the other fisherman.
Touched the life of Paul as he went with murderous threats to Damascus and changed his life
Stories of transformation from failure - &quot;they are fishermen, surely they should be able to catch some fish&quot; Jesus shows them how to move from catching fish to catching people. drawing people into the loving grace and peace of God.
Peter so full of regret and guilt after the denial of Jesus, that night must have been terrible for him
Proclaiming he would go to his death yet when the moment came, his courage failed.
Saul is asked &quot;why are you persecuting me?&quot;
These stories are not just about a distant past, they resonate today with Jesus touching every place and person.
How will Jesus touch our lives today?  Dramatically, gently, mysteriously?

01:00:26 - Prayers for the church and the world

28:50 - WE LISTEN FOR GOD’S WORD

29:11 - 32:40 - Reading 1 - John 20:19-31 

33:00 - Hymn: R&amp;S 552 From Heaven You came helpless babe 
 the third verse reflect the words of doubting Thomas.

37:36 - ALL AGE TALK – What’s in a nickname?.
We often don't know what our nicknames are unless they are polite
Our reading today from John's gospel makes it clear that Thomas has at least one nickname - Thomas the Doubter
Thomas did a lot of courageous and resilient things but is left with the abiding impression of the doubter
Not all doubts are bad
Doubting the claims of cold callers from &quot;Microsoft&quot;
Asking questions to confirm or quell doubts
Thomas did the same - had doubts but didn't keep them to himself and simply asked questions to clarify
Doubting whether God exists but doing nothing to test them, instead just living with the doubts.

43:24 - 45:48 - Reading 2 – Acts 5:27-32 

46:01 - 01:01:28 - Sermon: -  I wish I was more like Thomas!
In all of our services before and immediately after Easter, there are a number of people who get a bad press for their actions.
Most of the disciples and particularly Thomas get this.  
It's clear that none of the disciples came through this period with flying colours.  Judas, Peter, most of the rest running a mile when the going got tough.
So when Thomas comes in for criticism, he's not the only one who fails.
In the lent readings this year, the words used to describe the disciples was &quot;failed&quot;
Thinking that if God can work and live through failed disciples, maybe he can work and live through us
Looking in the reading where Jesus appears to the disciples less Thomas and Judas and then to them including Thomas
When Jesus appeared to the first group, he did three things - showed his wounds, commissioned them, and then breathed on them so they could receive the Holy Spirit.  So even before the disciples could question who this person was, Jesus gave them proof that he had risen.
&quot;As the Father sent me, so I send you&quot; - showing how God was dependent on the disciples to spread his word. 
That they had free will and had mutual dependency with Jesus
Tradition has it that Thomas was allocated India as his territory to convert and the St Thomas Christians today can trace themselves back to Thomas.
5 points to close
- Thomas is a clear example to us ass of how we are to fulfill Christ's commission today
- When we look at the ragbag collection of the Disciples, it must give us confidence that we too can be His disciples
- Do not be afraid of doubt and do not let it be a cover for dithering
- Clearly express your doubts and share them in fellowship
- Remember that our mission will be tough but with God's help it will not defeat us

   <media:description>00:00:00 - Music and notices before worship

12:48 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

15:00 - Call to worship with Easter Acclamation
This is the Good News – the grave is empty, Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!
This is the Good News – the light shines in the darkness
And the darkness can never put it out, for Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!
This is the Good News – once we were no people, but now we are God’s people, living the new life, for Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!
This is the Good News – Christ is our peace, the indestructible peace that touches us now and lifts our hearts in worship, 
for Christ is risen:
He is risen indeed!  Alleluia!

16:14 - Hymn 232 Christ the Lord is risen today omit verses 4 and 5

19:48 - Prayer of adoration 

21:42 - Introduction: ‘the great Easter Harvest’
So the long journey of Lent is over
Overshadowed for us this year by the terrible war in Ukraine
A wooden sculpture with a cross carved out backlit by sunshine and casting a shadow
A picture of the open tomb
A picture of a sunflower seed
Growing sunflowers
Linked to to Ukrainian sunflower harvest
The reading today telling how all this began on that great Easter morning

29:09 - 31:09 - Reading: Luke 24. 1 – 12 (NIVUK) read by Jeany Bien 
 
31:24 - Hymn MP 1105  See what a morning
(Activities for children are available during the service)

34:38 - 37:30 - Reading: Acts 10.34 – 43 (The Message) read by Larry Ogbewe

38:05 - Worship songs -    MP 14  All heaven declares
MP 220  He is Lord (1 verse sung twice)

42:17 - 54:45 - Short Address: ‘Women, Wondering, Words, Way, Witness’
 Each of the gospels bring their own angle on the story of Jesus, especially true as the story approaches Easter
John with the upper room, Matthew with an earthquake, Mark's abrupt account, Luke's story of the great meeting on the Emmaus road
Who are the ones who hear the good news first that Jesus is living - not the men who represent the patriarchy of the time, not the high priests, it's the faithful women who come to anoint the body
Even now the place of women in the church is not as it should be
The women are the great witnesses
Getting caught up with political, military or financial power and not hearing the voices of women
People wanting to be positive to trans-gender men and women whilst balancing the need to avoid belittling more than half of the world's population and ceasing to use the word women
God has raised Jesus, praise be to our risen Lord 

54:49 - Prayer of confession with the responses
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.
Christ have mercy: Christ have mercy.
Lord have mercy: Lord have mercy.
 
57:05 - Song MP 387 Jesus we celebrate your victory 

Prayer offering our lives for God’s work today

Living and Loving God, we come with our gifts
to offer the praise of our lips
and the service of our lives
through Jesus Christ 
our risen Lord and mighty Saviour.  Amen.

15:45 - Distribution of palm crosses

17:40 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

19:53 - 23:58 - Talk for all ages – from the point of view of the donkey
Imagine being a donkey in a village a couple of miles from Jerusalem
Still very young
Learning from your mother how to carry people and other burdens
Being asked for specifically
Setting off for Jerusalem
Feeling the excitement 
Hearing the crowds
All the noise and confusion
A special passenger

24:33 - Hymn R&amp;S 209 Ride on! Ride on in majesty 

26:32 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:

27:15 - 28:50 - Reading   Psalm 118 : 19-29 read by Arthur Winning

29:03 - 30:44 - Reading Luke 19: 28-42 read by Linda Curley

30:54 - Hymn R&amp;S 528  Jesus good above all other

33:53 - 47:00 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
Palm Sunday is one of the few stories recorded in all 4 gospels
All 4 writers had their own agenda and were addressing different audiences
As with Christmas, we tend to combine all of the stories together
Luke says nothing about palms of the crowd shouting hosannah, he only records people using cloaks to cover the donkey and the path
He misquotes psalm 118 with &quot;blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord&quot; when it reads &quot;blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord&quot;.  Luke has a theme of kingship in his gospel
Jesus was coming with a mission of peace, not what the crowd seem to be hoping for, calling to be saved form the hated occupiers
Jesus was coming humbly, in accordance with God's calling - what will they do with a messiah who comes in peace
This was Jesus' last, loving appeal to the people as he approached a place that had a special place in his heart
Does this event present any challenge to us today?
Who can we identify with?
Would we cheer, switch to shouting &quot;crucify&quot; in a few days?  Would we join with the disciples?
What would we have made of Jesus' tears and what do we make of them today
As we follow the story in the coming week, remember that we don't have to wait until the end of the week, we know the joy of resurrection and can welcome Jesus as the messiah into our lives now.

47:20 - Hymn R&amp;S  558  Will you come and follow me

52:37 - Hymn R&amp;S  261  At the name of Jesus

35:54 - Hymn R&amp;S 474 Brother, sister let me serve you

38:50 - 52:45 - Short Address: ‘Jesus – the anointed one’
The journey of Lent this year has been overshadowed by the horrific invasion of Ukraine
The world feels a darker and more fragile place
So we turn to the story of Jesus that can speak powerfully into our situation today
He lived in an occupied nation where a brutal regime imposed its power by force, crucifying thousands as a demonstration of strength
People of faith questioned why God had not liberated them
Injustice and corruption were rife
Into this chaos came Jesus, his integrity shone through confronting the authorities, challenging the religious leaders. For many, God was a small tribal God but Jesus introduced a God whose love knew no limit
Sometimes the weight of that ministry must have been too heavy to bear - sometimes he withdrew to Bethany to the homes of friends Martha and Mary.
According to John it was here he was anointed with precious oil.
In Luke the story appears earlier
For John, the anointing of Jesus, preparing him for all that is to come happens in a safe space in the home of friends.
Jesus stands up for Mary, refusing to allow her to be bullied by Judas.
&quot;You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me&quot;
Today, we need to stand up for those who are bullied or oppressed.  That is what Jesus does for each one of us, for all humanity

58:58 - Prayer of confession
Forgive us, faithful God,
when we fill the rooms we enter with negativity, not warmth:
Forgive us, and fill us with love.
Forgive us when we justify our reluctance to give and share,
blaming others rather than ourselves:
Forgive us, and fill us with love
Forgive us when we are slow to express gratitude,
and take what we have for granted.
Forgive us, and fill us with love.
In the name of the anointed One, Jesus Christ. Amen.
Be assured in the name of Jesus: Our sins are forgiven; we can
begin again, renewed by God’s Spirit. Thanks be to God. Amen.

Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says, “Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.” 7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent

15:18 - Call to worship (1 John 4. 7,9,11)
Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from
God. God showed his love for us by sending his only Son into the
world, that we might have life through him. If this is how God
loved us, then we should love one another.

15:52 - Hymn -  R&amp;S 30 Father we love you,

18:25 - Opening Prayer

20:38 - Introduction: ‘who do you say I am?’
Welcome as we continue our Lenten journey
We are beginning to relax some of our restrictions
Those at home won't see that we have tables out to help share our worship today
Our theme through Lent is to focus on Jesus and to answer the question he asked his followers - &quot;who do you say I am&quot;
How would you picture Jesus?
At the last supper Leonardo Da Vinci (1498), Christ Carrying the Cross byt El Greco (1580), Christ of St John of the Cross Salvador Dali (1951), Light of the World William Holman Hunt (1851), The Last Supper by Stanley Spencer Cookham (1920), The Found Life of Jesus Mafa (1970s), Christ on the Tube

42:55 - Worship songs - MP 375 Jesus, name above all names
R&amp;S 271 You are the King of Glory

47:25 - Reading: Luke 8. 19 – 21 

47:59 - 52-55 - Talk: being part of the family of Jesus - keep practicing
Does the reading sound harsh for Jesus' family?
In a sense he was turning his back on them, challenging the concept of family as a small, exclusive group, moving to a wider family with God
We draw back from that - blood is thicker than water.
For some, family is an immensely enriching experience, for others it's the opposite
Jesus says all of this has to be put in a new perspective - you are part of my family.  Hear my words and put them into practice
Jesus looks at each one of us and says those who have heard God's word, put them into practice
Mothering Sunday next week
Honoring those women who take care of us

53:10 - Activity: making cards to give to members of this church family

18:30 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

21:45 - Reading  Luke 13 vv 31 – 35 read by Sparks family

22:50 - 26:55 - All age Introduction 
We seems to be bombarded with special offers wherever we go
If we like it, we'll go for it.
Sometimes it's too good to be true
We have the choice to take advantage or not
Jesus' special offer to us is very good value - letting us live life to the full not just now but forever and how much does it cost us - nothing.  Jesus has already paid the full price
In our reading we see Jesus sad - longing to give his people the love they need to make their lives a whole lot richer
Does it seem too good to be true?  Are we not worthy of the offer.  Why do many humans say &quot;no thanks&quot; and miss out on the wonderful life God can give?

27:03 - Hymns &amp;Worship songs 
R&amp;S 363: Lord Jesus think on me
Purify my heart MP921
 
33:05 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:

33:15 - 34:35 - Reading: Jeremiah 2 vv 30 – 37  read by Sparks family

34:45 - Hymn R&amp;S 522: From heaven you came helpless babe

39:20 - 55:28 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
Supporting the national centre for Epilepsy in Chalfont Common
Hearing negative talk about the development of the centre &quot;we don't need any more of that sort&quot;
Most people are supportive and want to applaud those who help but this changes once they find out the halfway house will help criminals or the mentally ill
What was once a good idea is rejected because it is happening next door
What causes this - is it fear, for them or their children, is it financial?
Jeremiah faces the rejection and wrath of the people but still speaks what God has told him to say
Our Lord is for ever loving and gracious

56:14 - Hymn R&amp;S 620: For the healing of the nations

59:08 - Prayers of intersession

Offering  Prayer of Dedication

01:06:02 - Hymn R&amp;S262: Crown him with many crowns

00:11:00 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)
13:00 -Call to worship 
As we come to worship today let us say of our God:
You are the One who is my refuge and my fortress, 
my God, in whom I trust.  
Lord open our lips
And our mouths shall proclaim your praise! 

13:40 - Song - R&amp;S 292  When morning gilds the skies

16:58 - 19:00 - Prayer of adoration and confession 

19:04 - Introduction: ‘Into Lent’
Ashing services at the start of Lent
&quot;From dust you came, to dust you will return.  Turn from your sins and turn to Christ&quot;
Think about names that are important in life today?  Zelenskyy, Hope, Gary, Brian, Tracey, David, Greta, Pat, Tintin
Our names are important to us
The most important name and the answer to all questions in all age talks - Jesus
Asking &quot;who is Jesus to us and what does it mean to follow Jesus today?&quot;
H.G.Wells -  &quot;I am an historian, I am not a believer, but I must confess as a historian that this penniless preacher from Nazareth is irrevocably the very center of history. Jesus Christ is easily the most dominant figure in all history.&quot;
The Son of God and the Son of Man
Jesus wanted to be close to humanity

27:34 - 28:47 - Reading: Romans 10.8b – 13 (Good News) 

29:30 - 35:57 - Song - TP 102 You laid aside your majesty, MP 477 - My Peace I Give Unto You

37:01 - 38:40 - Reading: Luke 4.1-13 NIVUK read by Lesley Bogart

38:50 - 56:00 - Short Address: ‘Jesus – Son of God, Son of Man’
It's a vivid picture and story of Jesus and the Devil.
Wrestling with evil in the wilderness
The struggle between the two has echoed down through history
The struggle between good and evil, love and hate, life and death
We see it played out in the messy world of politics and most recently in the situation in Ukraine
We pray that efforts to arrange a ceasefire bear fruit
Of course it's not just played out &quot;out there&quot;, it's played out within ourselves
Too often we try to help ourselves at the expense of others
Even the church in Russia has played its part in a mythology that Ukraine is part of Mother Russia
We pray that Patriarch Kirill will speak out against the violence.
We are caught up in this, it's not just about others.
We pray that further escalation in Ukraine can be avoided

56:02 - 59:55 - Worship Song from Ukraine 
“I will Sing,” by Maria Kuchurian &amp; Diana Yakovyn

He is the One who lifts up and surrounds with peace.
His love is great! I will hold on to Him.
When the heart is heavy, He takes away the stone,
Gently hugs. O my holy Jesus!
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing to the Risen King!
His hand is with me. He's near, here, I know
I feel in my heart, I pray to Him!
He warms with love and wipes away tears
Loyal Friend forever. His name is Jesus!
You chose me and set me up, You chose me, raised me up!
You chose me and forgave me, You chose me, raised me!
You chose me and filled me, You chose me, raised me!

59:59 - 01:04:22 - Prayer for peace in Ukraine
The psalmist writes: “I call on the Lord in my distress,
and he answers me.”
Lord, we call to you in our distress.
We trust you to answer us.
We lift up the people of Ukraine before you…

WE APPROACH GOD

07:35 - Entry of the bible and lighting of the peace candle
09:00 - Call to worship – based on Matthew 5 and Luke 6 
Blest are the poor in spirit, 
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Blest are they that mourn, 
For they shall be comforted. 
Blest are the meek,
For they shall inherit the earth.

09:51 - Hymn - R&amp;S 339 – Great God, your love has called us here. 
 -
14:25 Introduction
15:25 - PRAYERS - of Approach, Thanksgiving, Confession &amp;  Praise     
LORD'S PRAYER
-
20:27 - 25:30 - FAMILY TALK – In search of happiness
Who knows Timpson's?
A well known, family run business.
Run with great integrity.
They have just appointed a director of happiness.
What makes you happy? Arguing about one's age?
Family and friends, Lego spaceships, sunshine, sweets, ice cream, friends
The next question - what makes your parents happy?
A tidy room? Space and time?
The real question - what makes God happy?
We can get an understanding of this when we read the Beatitudes
Those who are humble, not constantly taking selfies, merciful, not vengeful, those who work for peace, not trying to conquer lands

- 
40:18 - 55:30 - SERMON – Jam tomorrow?
An amusing story about the last hymn (All my hope on God is founded)
This service was first used at Chesham a couple of weeks ago. Chesham have some masonry fallen off one of the towers.
As the hymn was sung, most of the Elders were struggling not to giggle as the words &quot;with what care and toil is build-ed, tower and temple fall to dust&quot; rang out
Do you remember more than a decade ago when David Cameron asked the Office for National Statistics to come up with a happiness index?
The sermon on the mount and sermon on the plain having the same roots, extending into the Old Testament
Listeners to Christ would have known the links and known that Jesus was referring back to Chronicles, Psalms, and Isaiah.
Luke presents us with a choice - do you want to be a citizen of God's kingdom or a citizen of the Roman Empire (or whatever empire is around today)?
Do you want to be generous or greedy, merciful or vengeful, peaceful or militant, part of the solution or part of the problem
May we live full lives in this topsy turvy world
