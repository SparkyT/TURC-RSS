26:49 - Hymn - Be still for the presence of our Lord

29:59 - 43:32 - Short Address 
Reflecting on what it means to be human from a faith perspective.
Psalm 8, which contrasts human insignificance with God's mindfulness of humanity.
The destructive aspects of human behavior, including environmental damage and war.
Jesus' welcome of children is highlighted as a radical act in its historical context.
The praise of children is presented as a powerful force against evil.
The psalm speaks of humanity being crowned with glory and honor by God.
Jesus is described as the truest human, who has shared in human suffering.
The creation of a new human family through Jesus' grace is emphasized.
Being human involves recognizing our insignificance while also embracing our God-given dignity.

This sermon explores the complex nature of humanity through a Christian lens, drawing on Psalm 8 and the teachings of Jesus. It grapples with the paradox of human insignificance in the face of the universe's vastness, while also affirming the unique value and responsibility God places on humanity. The speaker addresses both the destructive capacities of humans and their potential for compassion and praise. Jesus is presented as the model of true humanity, offering a path to a new family united by divine grace. The sermon concludes by defining being human as a balance between humility before God and the honor of being part of God's creation, with the communion table serving as a symbol of this united humanity.

Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus travelled along the border

men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called
out in a loud voice, ‘Jesus, Master, have pity on us!.
When he saw them, he said ‘Go, show yourself to the priests.’ And
as they went they were cleansed.
One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back in a loud
voice. He threw himself at Jesus feet and thanked him – and he was
a Samaritan.

40:16 - 43:18 - HYMN R&amp;S 353 There’s a wideness in God’s mercy

43:25 - 52:51 - Short Address
Questions are an integral part of faith and shouldn't be denied.
The Christian journey involves asking big questions without fear.
Hebrew scriptures lacked punctuation, leaving room for interpretation.
Questions can be asked with different intentions - some seek answers, others make points.
Open-mindedness is crucial when asking questions in faith.
The sermon explores various types of questions in biblical passages.
God asks heartfelt questions to humanity through prophets.
The prophets convey God's longing for people to return to Him.
Micah's question &quot;What does the Lord require of you?&quot; is central to the sermon.
The sermon concludes with three key actions: act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.

52:57 - 54:44 - Affirmation based on Micah 4. 2 – 5
Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
to the house of the God of Jacob;
that God may teach us his ways
and that we may walk in his paths.
God shall judge between many peoples,
and shall arbitrate between strong nations
They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
and their spears into pruning-hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.
All shall sit under their own vines and under their own fig
trees, and no one shall make them afraid;
for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.
For all the peoples walk, each in the name of their god.
We will walk in the name of the Lord our God
for ever and ever.

56:07 - 01:04:09 - Prayers of intercession using TP 75 Peace I give to you

01:04:10 - Offering Prayer
God of all life,
You do not desire the sacrifice of animals or rivers of oil,
but rather justice and loving kindness.
So help us by your Spirit,
to practice justice and fairness
to love kindness and compassion
and to walk each day humbly with you,
our Gracious God and the God of all life.
We pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.

12:44 - 14:40 - Prayer of Confession and Assurance of Forgiveness
We come before God held in the knowledge we are loved,
and with assurance that we are transformed through
God’s love.
Loving shepherd, we come to you to confess
That there are times when we live like sheep without a
shepherd. Times we allow our busyness to drive us from
places of rest.
Times we choose paths of discord rather than loving
kindness.
Times we embrace despair rather than hope
Jesus is the good shepherd who has pity on his flock
And promises goodness and love will be with us
Follow your shepherd on the right paths,
And do so in the knowledge you are loved and forgiven.
Amen.

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00 - Music before the service

04:30 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

04:43 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

05:59 - Call to worship (from Psalm 104)
Praise the LORD, my soul!
Lord my God, how great you are!
You make springs flow in the valleys,
and rivers run between the hills.
In the trees near by, the birds make their nests and sing.
From the sky you send rain on the hills,
and the earth is filled with your blessings.
All creatures – and we ourselves - depend on you:
when you open your hand, all are satisfied
with good things.

07:22 - 10:06 - HYMN R&amp;S 117 O Lord my God (vs. 1 and 2 only)

10:10 - Opening Prayer with the response
For all your gifts and blessings:
We praise you, God of all people.

17:55 - 22:34 - Introduction: ‘Elijah the outsider’

23:21 - 25:07 - Reading: 1 Kings 17. 1 – 10 read by Rosemary Taylor

25:35 - 36:30 - Talk: ‘Fed by the ravens!’
The importance of serving God, not idols or selfish interests, like Elijah served the God of Israel.
The story of Elijah being fed by ravens highlights humanity's interconnectedness with nature.
Questioning the belief that humans are superior to nature and can live without it.
The story of the widow's unending flour and oil symbolizes God's provision in times of scarcity.
The valuable role of the poor widow in helping Elijah.
Jesus referenced the story of the widow, praising those who give even a cup of water.
The need for recognizing interdependence and reliance on God.
Jesus' teaching about God's care for even small sparrows.
Praying to God as a caring, heavenly Father.

Pause: ‘Happy Father’s Day!’

36:48 - Lord’s Prayer

37:40 - 40:29 - HYMN R&amp;S 64 I lift my eyes to the quiet hills

40:40 - 44:00 - Consider: How do you react to a crisis or a danger in your
life? Do you prefer to ‘fight’ or prefer ‘flight’ or simply
‘freeze’?!

44:04 - 47:06 - Reading: 1 Kings 19.9 – 20a read by Norma Garden

47:19 - 57:44 - Reflection: ‘meeting God in the silence’
Elijah depressed and in self-pity after his triumph over the prophets of Baal.
Elijah catastrophized, feeling alone and that everyone had deserted him except for God.
God questioned Elijah's presence in the cave, calling him out of his despair and isolation.
Rather than appearing in dramatic natural phenomena, God came to Elijah in a &quot;gentle whisper&quot; or &quot;still small voice.&quot;
Contrast the noise of our world with the stark silence Elijah experienced in the cave.
Silence is challenging yet powerful, allowing space for God's voice amidst the inner noise of thoughts.
Different translations describing God's voice as a &quot;soft whisper,&quot; &quot;sound of sheer silence,&quot; and &quot;still small voice.&quot;
Elijah realized he was in the presence of the holy God, covering his face in response.
God met Elijah not in dramatic displays but in the stillness and quiet whisper.


Ponder: ‘We spend most of our lives focussed on three
verbs: to want, to have and to do. But none of these verbs
has any ultimate significance until it is transcended by and
included in the fundamental verb: to be.’ (Evelyn Underhill)

58:25 - 01:00:32 - HYMN MP 48 Be still and know that I am God

01:00:59 - Further Exploration: ‘Jesus and Elijah’

01:03:26 - 01:05:53 - Reading: Matthew 17. 1 – 13 read by Terry

01:06:11 - 01:10:58 - HYMN R&amp;amp;S 492 Dear Lord and Father of mankind

01:11:19 - 01:18:48 - Prayers for the church and the world using verses of
HYMN TP 56 Kum ba ya

01:19:04 - 01:21:59 - HYMN R&amp;S 531 Lord of all hopefulness

01:22:00 - 01:22:17 - Blessing

01:22:47 - 01:25:31 - Music after the service

34:18 - 39:41 - Talk - Prophets
The role of prophets in ancient Israel, including major and minor prophets in the Old and New Testaments.
Prophets were honest truth-tellers close to God, sometimes speaking out at great personal cost.
Prophecy involved discerning the signs of the times and God's wisdom, not just future predictions.
There were also female prophets like Miriam, Deborah, and Isaiah's wife, though less known.
The story of the prophet Nathan confronting King David over his sin with Bathsheba is examined.
David abused his power by summoning Bathsheba and impregnating her, then ordering her husband Uriah's death.
Nathan uses a parable to make David realize his guilt before directly accusing him.
The prophets called for repentance and change, as the future was not set.
David repents after Nathan's confrontation, though he still faces consequences.
Prophecy involved speaking truth to power, even to kings who could have the prophet killed.

40:00 - 42:21 - Reading: 2 Samuel 12. 1 – 10 NIVUK read by Ian Bogart

43:35 - 47:37 - HYMN R&amp;S 621  Almighty Father

47:41 - 01:00:06 - Short Address 
Jesus was dismissed as just a carpenter when he returned to his hometown of Nazareth, but he embraced the title of prophet.
Honoring the prophets and hearing what they have to say, especially during political campaigns filled with empty words and promises.
The story of the prophet Nathan confronting King David about his sin with Bathsheba is examined.
Nathan uses a parable to make David realize his own guilt before directly accusing him, showing the power of stories.
Prophets are called to speak truth to power, even at great personal risk.
There are consequences for sin, as seen in David's family being divided by conflict after his actions.
However, genuine repentance like David's leads to God's forgiveness, though consequences may still remain.
A parallel between the injustice done to the poor man's lamb and the injustice of Jesus' death.
Encouraging hearing the stories of the poor and marginalized in society.
Despite sin and tragedy, there is hope for a new beginning through God's grace and truth.

01:01:29 - 01:06:27 - Prayers of intercession with the response
Lord, may your kingdom of justice and joy come:
