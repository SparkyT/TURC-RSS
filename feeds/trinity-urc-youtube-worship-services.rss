Welcome and lighting of peace candle (elder)

Introduction and Call to worship
Psalm 93 v 1-5
The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty;
the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength;
indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
Your throne was established long ago;
you are from all eternity.
The seas have lifted up, LORD,
the seas have lifted up their voice;
the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
Mightier than the thunder of the great waters,
mightier than the breakers of the sea –
the LORD on high is mighty.
Your statutes, LORD, stand firm;
holiness adorns your house
for endless days

Hymn MP13 All hail the power of Jesus name

Opening prayers and the Lord’s prayer

Reading Revelation Ch 1 vv 4b – 8 read by Lesley Bogart
Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to
come, and from the seven spirits [a]  before his throne,  5  and from Jesus
Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the
ruler of the kings of the earth.
To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,  6  and
has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father –
to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen
7  ‘Look, he is coming with the clouds,’
    and ‘every eye will see him,
even those who pierced him’;
    and all peoples on earth ‘will mourn because of him.’
So shall it be! Amen.
8  ‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’ says the Lord God, ‘who is, and who
was, and who is to come, the Almighty.’
Introduction to theme of the service
Hymn MP 207 Hallelujah sing to Jesus
Reading John18 vv 33b – 37 read by Ian Bogart
33  Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked
him, ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’
34  ‘Is that your own idea,’ Jesus asked, ‘or did others talk to you about
me?’
35  ‘Am I a Jew?’ Pilate replied. ‘Your own people and chief priests handed
you over to me. What is it you have done?’

36  Jesus said, ‘My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants
would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my
kingdom is from another place.’
37  ‘You are a king, then!’ said Pilate.

13:04 - Hymn - God is Love, let heaven adore Him

16:50 - Opening Prayers and Lord’s Prayer 

20:08 - 25:49 - Introductory Talk – “Dark and Light”

What was special about Sunday, 31st October, 2 weeks ago
A 25 hour day - what did you do with the additional hour?
Darker earlier in the day
Different shades of light and dark
Close your eyes and cover them to experience the darkness
Remembering the dark times of war

Being able to meet family again


25:50 - Song - The Lord’s my Shepherd led by the worship band

Blessing as Junior Church depart

46:18 - Prayer 
47:30 - 01:00:18 - Sermon – “Promises, promises!”
The gospel reading talks about war.
It follows on from Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem but we know it comes before the darkest of dark times when Jesus was crucified
The disciples comment to Jesus about how magnificent the temple stones were.
12m long, 4m deep and 6m high, huge pieces of stone that look as if they will be there for ever
Jesus disabuses the disciples of this saying the stones will collapse and every stone will be thrown down.
A shock to the disciples
Jesus is anticipating the destruction of Jerusalem in AD70
Jesus gives the disciples some of the signs of the end of the age
Jesus makes it clear that they should not worry but to watch and be prepared.
Promises made and promises kept?  Do our politicians keep their promises?
COP26 in Glasgow, what promises have been made and which will be kept
Greta Thunberg and &quot;Blah, blah, blah&quot;

A glorious autumn day, the leaves are falling but taking their time

Stretch your mind across the amazing universe which we are discovering more about but still have so much to find; across this planet with all the diverse species

How would we deal with losing our sight?
Listening to Nunc Dimitus
The more I heard the music, the thought of not hearing felt worse than not being able to see
Close your eyes for a few moments and imagine you are blind
How will you survive, how will you work, how will you move around.
23:45 - Song - Jesus, Hope of the nations
28:23 - 30:08 - Reading - Mark 10, 46-52

Lines from the reading from Mark
The striking contrast in the reading, a great multitude and a lone individual
It is impressive to see Jesus turn his attention from the crowd to the one.
There is evidence of something deeper than just being aware of surroundings
This narrative comes with pertinence for a generation that acts on multitudes and quantities
The lowest in society can too easily get lost
What does our manner say about us
Are we like the crowd or Jesus?

Refreshments are being served after church (in the Meeting Place – please bring it back into church to drink).  Do stay if you can.  

Sight Loss Sunday is a new initiative from Torch Trust. It has two main purposes: 
• To raise awareness of the prevalence of sight loss in church and local community. 
• To encourage Christians to nurture the unique gifts, talents and abilities that people with sight loss can bring to church life. 
Torch Trust believes that all people with sight loss have a valuable part to play in churches and Christian communities, and Sight Loss Sunday is designed to equip us to live out these values in our own congregation.  Founded in 1959, Torch Trust offers Christian products and services to improve the lives of people with sight loss. They offer Bibles, hymn books and a whole variety of publications in a range of accessible formats including braille, large print and audio. They contribute to RNIB Connect Radio with &quot;Reflections&quot; which airs on a Sunday morning.   They also offer a range of bespoke Christian holidays for people with sight loss.  Their &quot;Sight Loss Friendly Church&quot; initiative offers training, support and advice to churches of all denominations who wish to be more inclusive of people with sight loss.  They provide regular training sessions and catch-up sessions online.

Both Trinity and Cores End Churches are registered as Sight Loss Friendly Churches and we want to do everything we can to include all people, whatever their abilities, in the life and work of the church.  For more information please speak to Sue after the service or visit the Torch Trust website:

Are you beginning anything new at the moment - a new book, puzzle or TV series
Beginnings in the world of nature - snowdrops and daffodils
Last week in the Church calendar we move from Christmas to epiphany.
Today we focus on the baptism of Jesus
26:06 - 27:15 - Reading Genesis Ch1 vv1-5
27:20 - Song - As the sun rises on a new day
31:58 - Meditation
Some of you will have been doing jigsaws over the Christmas period
A meditation on a jigsaw puzzle to reflect on our own lives and how the jumble of pieces is brought together
34:44 - Prayer
35:19 - Talk
The picture of Christ knowing he is loved by God and pleasing to him
35:47 - Reading - Mark 1, 1-11
38:17 - 50:11 - Talk
The news this week has been increasingly grim:  Spiralling COVID numbers, schools closed a day after opening, a new lockdown, events in America. We won't want to see another week like that any time soon
There may be hope behind the headlines - the vaccination programme increasing, education continuing, American democracy has survived
Our reading is all about new beginnings
In just 11 verses, Mark takes to the declaration of Jesus as the son of God.  Nothing about the birth, his focus is the baptism where Jesus begins his ministry and &quot;goes public&quot;
Three aspects of that baptism: Jesus was baptised alongside the crowd of ordinary people, Jesus was baptised by John, that great prophet of the old testament, and Jesus was baptised by the spirit.

50:15 - Prayers of intercession

What is the YMCA
Founded by George Williams, came from a farming family but was sent off to the nearest town to learn the cloth trade.
Challenged by the long hours, low pay and lack of care in the workplace he felt the Lord had restored him and wanted him to help young men experience the benefits he had.
2 introductory videos.
Why people become homeless, how the YMCA helps get them back on their feet, working with Wycombe Homeless Connection to be the next stage of the journey back to independence



33:43 - Song -  All I once held dear MP799

37:07 - Introduction to Bible readings

Readings:  Matthew 9:9 
Matthew 25:31 – 40 



Matthew 28:16 – 20 
read by Sarah and Samuel Evans

40:35 - 01:03:26 - Address
Thinking about &quot;calling&quot;
What comes to mind when you think about being called?
Batman? With the boy wonder Robin by his side
A shining light in the sky alerting them to need
Our political leaders have been setting out their stalls at the party conferences wanting people to heed their calls
#BuildBackBetter #GettingOnWithTheJob
Jesus' call is not like any of these, he is claiming to be the Messiah
A simple message - &quot;follow me&quot;.  Not &quot;because this or that&quot;, just &quot;follow me&quot;
Jesus isn't like any earthly leader, dying and coming back to life , an eternal change
Remember that Jesus himself was homeless, not nice lunch after the service.  He needed the help and care of others to live, sleep and eat.
Being called to love and serve others

01:03:28 - Hymn -  I the Lord of sea and sky MP857

22:02 - Introduction: ‘Buildings and Birthdays’
Good to be in this building where worship has been offered for 171 years

Rethinking how we offer worship
What's the future of this building - we are thinking and praying about that 
What makes a good building? Foundations, a good design, a purpose
Building with bananas
Celebrating 49 years of worship since the foundation of the URC

39:45 - Introducing the readings (URC Anniversary on 5 October)
Reading: Psalm 133
Reader: How good and pleasant it is
All: when God’s people live together in unity!
Reader: It is like precious oil poured on the head,
All:  running down on the beard,
Reader: running down on Aaron’s beard,
All: down on the collar of his robe.
Reader: It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion.
All: For there the LORD bestows his blessing,
   even life for evermore.
Reader: Glory to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
All: as it was in the beginning,
is now and ever shall be. Amen

42:21 - Reading: 1 Peter 2. 1 – 10 (NIVUK) 

44:34 - Song - As we are gathered (sung once seated)

46:13 - 55:50 - Short Address

Stones are amazing things
A pebble on the beach, always fascinating, always tempting to throw into the sea
Fascinating with all the history of years
Sculpted into amazing shapes
Built into places of worship
But still lifeless on their own
Today we are talking about the miracle of living stones
A paradoxical picture
This reminds me of Lithops - the tiny plants that look like stones
Peters reference to living stones in the reading indicating Jesus
Jesus who is placed in a tomb then raised back to life by God, the cornerstone of life

57:05 - Affirmation (from the URC Statement):
Held together in the Body of Christ
through the freedom of the Spirit,
we rejoice in the diversity of the Spirit’s gifts…
We affirm our intention to go on praying
and working, with all our fellow Christians,
for the visible unity of the Church
in the way Christ chooses,
so that people and nations
may be led to love and serve God
and praise God, more and more, forever. Amen.

Getting back to singing in Church has been great
Psalms are the great hymn-book of the bible, prayers and poetry for believers
150 hymns or prayers
Huge variety from lament to joy
Jesus sang psalms with his his disciples and then references Psalm 22 when on the cross, finally commending himself into his father's hands using psalm 31

Psalm 23 inspired many people, George Herbert, Isaac Watts and Henry Baker

The history of the psalms

01:01:53 - Offering Prayer 
Psalm 116 says ‘What can I offer the LORD for all his goodness to
me?’. We keep a moment of quiet to reflect on what we can offer
for God’s work today…
We offer our gifts to you, Lord of all life
Our gifts of money for your work
the gift of music and poetry for your praise
and the gift of our lives for the work of your kingdom.
To you be glory for ever and ever. Amen

16:05 - 2nd Sunday in Advent - Walking the Way focus on peace 
As the second candle of Advent is lit, we consider the peace which God offers
but also calls us to maintain in the world around us as we await the coming
of Jesus. Although peace is a strong tie which binds different groups from
various backgrounds, creeds, and opinions firmly together, it can also be
undeniably fragile. It takes a lot of hard work to unite different groups,
especially when people disagree or hold grudges. It takes even more
commitment to keep people united, getting to know each other more closely
as they grow and develop together. As we wait for Jesus’ arrival at Christmas,
now is an ideal time to begin that process of unity, working towards a lasting
peace. 

17:33 - Reading (based on Psalm 85. 8-10)

19:06 - Hymn - Advent candle song (Tune: 185 Glenfinlas)
Come and light the candles, on the Advent ring
Scattering the darkness, till the world shall sing.
Lighting the second Advent candle
All: Shine your light, Lord
in our hearts and our world,
in our praying and our living,
that PEACE may be reborn,
your everlasting PEACE. Amen.

20:21 - Reading Isaiah 40. 1-11 NIVUK 

22:48 - Song - Peace perfect peace 

25:20 - Reading Mark 1. 1 – 8 NIVUK 

27:24 - 39:07 Short talk: ‘prepare for what?’
A key word in advent is &quot;Prepare&quot;
What are we preparing for?
Buy a huge turkey or a small chicken
Preparing is important but what happens if we have no clue what to prepare for
What can businesses do to prepare for what how pandemic will evolve
The Government says &quot;be ready&quot; with regards to Brexit, but be ready for what
&quot;Make sure you are ready&quot; could be a great slogan for advent
Today's readings ask us to prepare for the Lord
Wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever you have done, here is your God, prepare to receive him

14:01 - Hymn 104 Praise my soul the king of heaven

18:16 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

21:33 - Reading: James 3 vv1 – 12 read by Tony Hatton

23:42 - 26:50 - Talk for all ages
Being a disciple and being obedient
Playing &quot;Simon says&quot;
In life we are often told or asked to do things that aren't easy
Obedience to God is more important than to anyone else

26:51 - Song 522 From heaven you came, helpless babe

32:03 - Reading: Mark 8 vv 27 – 38 

34:15 - 48:49 - Address
The first announcement of the passion makes it clear that Jesus doesn't want his disciples to come under false pretences
He never asked them to come on a picnic
Suffering, the cross and death were in plain view
Unless we see that clearly, we miss the glory of the gospel
Jesus spoke plainly of the cost of discipleship
Many times we do not follow his frankness, mumbling his words
John Bowering puts it this way: &quot;When the sun of bliss is beaming, light and love upon my way. From the cross the radiant streaming adds more lustre to the day&quot;

06:02 - Welcome and introduction 
06:30 - Lighting of the peace candle
07:33 - Call to worship (from Psalm 100)
Let us worship the LORD with gladness;
Let us come before God with joyful songs.
Let us give thanks to the Lord
Let us praise God’s name.
For the LORD is good:
God’s love endures for ever! Praise the Lord!

07:58 - Hymn - Come, now is the time to worship (Music Group)
We invite you to sing the hymns while wearing your mask.

10:24 - Opening Prayer of adoration and confession

12:35 - Introduction: ‘food, glorious food’
Did you have a good breakfast this morning
A traditional fry up or something more healthy
Did you have more time to cook during lockdown?
We've been sharing our magazine with lockdown recipes over the past months
Who tried the lockdown crumble or the nettle and wild garlic soup?
At this time in the calendar we think about our relationship with the planet and our care for God's creation
Moving towards a more plant based diet to help 
Focusing on food insecurity at our harvest service
Sharing communion to feed on the love of Christ

21:40 - Reading: Isaiah 55. 1 – 7 

23:50 - Song - Jesus, the Lord, says I am the bread

27:30 - Reading: Luke 15.11 – 31 

31:00 - Prayer
31:39 - Short Address
Food is so basic to our lives and yet so much more than just a bunch of calories
It's part of our culture and history, it affects our health and mood and can be a source of joy, blessing, anxiety and injustice
High Wycombe as a hotspot of food insecurity in 2021
We will focus on the work of our local food bank in our harvest celebrations but today I want to look at food for the soul
We have the familiar, famous story from Luke's gospel about the lost son.
Food has an essential place in this story
Looking at the Rembrandt painting of the scene, picturing the returning son broken and in rags, kneeling before his father.  The focus though is on the father who embraces his son and welcomes him back
Sharing communion together 



48:03 - Hymn - I am the bread of life

51:34 - Offering Prayer and Lord's prayer

54:15 - Offering of bread and wine 
We invite you to share in the bread and wine at church (or at
home) united in the name of Christ.
Thanksgiving Prayer and Lord’s Prayer
Distribution of bread and wine (Music during distribution)

59:18 - Closing Prayers

01:03:40 - Hymn - Guide me O thou great Redeemer

01:06:35 - 01:06:51 - Blessing

01:07:20 - 01:10:25 - Organ voluntary
