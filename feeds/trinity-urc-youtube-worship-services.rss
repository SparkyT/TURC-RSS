10:34 - 12:47 - Opening Prayers 

12:50 - 25:00 - All age Talk: ‘Beginning and ending, alpha and omega’ 
The theme of beginnings and endings, both in life and in literature.
Examples of beginnings and endings including new jobs, the start of the Premier League season, the flow of the Thames River, the story of Peter Rabbit, and the start of school holidays.
The Book of Revelation as a strange and often misunderstood book, but encourages exploration and finding the treasures within it.
The Book of Revelation is described as a record of events revealed by Jesus Christ to the servant John.
God is much bigger than our comprehension and is eternal.
Jesus Christ is described as the faithful Witness, the ruler of kings, and the one who loves and freed us from sin.
Don't misuse the Book of Revelation but engage in individual exploration rather than relying on external interpretations. In particular, don't just Google the book of revelation
Approach the book with bravery and listen to the Spirit speaking to them.

&quot;God is always bigger than our comprehension.&quot; 
&quot;The Book of Revelation: Find the treasures within.&quot;
&quot;Be brave enough to explore the Book of Revelation and hear the Spirit speaking to you.&quot;

29:55 - Reading: Revelation 1. 9 – 16 NIVUK read by Tony

31:39 - Reading: Revelation 3. 14 – 22 NIVUK read by Elsje

34:35 - 37:02 - Hymn - R&amp;S 405 Angel voices

37:10 - 49:54 - Short Address
The Book of Revelation can be challenging and bewildering, causing discomfort and fear for some readers.
There were debates in the early church about whether to include the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, but it ultimately became part of the Bible.
The book was written by John, who was exiled to the island of Patmos due to his witness, and it emerged from a context of persecution under the Roman Empire.
Revelation belongs to the apocalyptic genre, which contrasts earthly and heavenly life and speaks of a struggle between good and evil.
Violent imagery in Revelation should not be taken literally; at its core is Jesus, who sacrificed himself for humanity.
The book begins with letters to seven churches, including the church of Laodicea, which is criticized for its complacency and lukewarm faith.
Jesus is portrayed as knocking on the door of the Laodicean church, urging them to open their hearts and let him in.
The invitation to open the door symbolizes a personal and intimate relationship with Jesus.
The book invites readers to open their hearts, minds, spirits, and lives to the loving Lord, who offers forgiveness, purpose, and love.

&quot;Do not panic. If you don't warm to the Book of Revelation, you're in good company.&quot;
&quot;Be patient with the book; it's full of imagery. It isn't a description of reality as such; it was a vision that came to John in the context of worship.&quot;
&quot;Here I am, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with them and they with me.&quot;

read by Sue Thorne

32:06 - 35:06 - Reading: Matthew 9: 35-38 and 10: 1-8
read by John Hillson

35:24 - 37:42 - Hymn: To Abraham and Sarah the call of God was clear (R&amp;S 553) Tune: Mountain Christians

37:55 - 51:37 - Sermon: followed by time of quiet reflection
3 key words: visitors, hospitality, compassion
The scriptures highlight the theme of visitors and hospitality, starting with Abraham and Sarah encountering three visitors in Genesis.
People in the Bible are constantly on the move, encountering new situations and meeting strangers, emphasizing the theme of journeys and travel.
Change and unexpected circumstances can disrupt and transform our lives, whether by our own choices, actions of others, sickness, suffering, or blessings.
God is found amidst our wanderings and encounters, often visiting us in surprising and unrecognized ways, delivering blessings beyond our imagination.
Jesus is the ultimate visitor, entering fully into human life, teaching, healing, and showing compassion to those in need, revealing God's new way of being with us.
Jesus' presence transcends time and space through his death, resurrection, and Ascension, making his home forever with us.
Suffering and need are prevalent in the world, and amidst these realities, the stories of Abraham, Sarah, and Jesus offer hope, compassion, and love.
God invites people to join in the work of compassion and salvation, as seen in Abraham and Sarah being part of God's unfolding story and the disciples being commissioned and sent out.
The disciples' names and our own names are part of the ongoing story of God's saving and renewing all of creation, with unique callings and opportunities for each individual.
As we respond to God's call, we can be answers to prayer, revealing God's heart of compassion, seeking justice, and taking action, even if the laborers may seem few.
Welcoming people in need

God sees you the way that Jesus sees you.
You are perfect in Christ.
You may be going through a tough time, but God still loves you.
God will exchange his son for you.
You are worth as much as God originally made you to be.
God is our heavenly father, and he is the shepherd who leads us.
Comparing a 10-pound note to a person's worth. Even if the note is wrinkled or damaged, it is still worth 10 pounds.

26:56 - Readings: Psalm 116 vs 1, &amp;amp; 10 – 17
read by Arthur Winning

28:08 - Romans Ch 5 vs 1 – 8 read by Jeany Bien

30:52 - Hymn - How deep the Father’s love for us

34:31 - 56:18 - Address “God demonstrates His Love”
followed by time of quiet reflection
The sermon emphasizes that being a Christian is about what God has done through Jesus Christ, not our own actions or words.
Jesus was credited as righteous by God for paying the penalty of sin, even though he was without sin himself.
We cannot pay the debt of our sin ourselves; it requires a perfect sacrifice, which Jesus provided as the Lamb of God.
By putting our sins on Jesus and accepting him through faith, we are considered righteous in God's sight.
Through Jesus' death and resurrection, our sins have been paid for, and we are set free from the penalty of sin.
Faith is crucial in accepting this freedom and trusting in what Jesus and God have promised.
Our trust in God should not waver, even in the face of suffering, as it produces endurance, character, and hope.
God's love for us is demonstrated by Christ's death for sinners, even when we were still ungodly.
We are justified and have peace with God through faith, becoming his children and sharing in his glory.
Reading God's word helps us grow spiritually and deepen our faith, as it reveals the character and love of God.
Suffering should not discourage or deter believers from their faith, but rather it should be seen as an opportunity for spiritual growth and an occasion to deepen our trust in God

The two children sponsored by our church, Christian and Mary, and mentions that other individuals in the congregation also sponsor children.
Compassion is a child-focused, church-based charity with projects in 29 countries, providing resources to alleviate poverty for sponsored children and their families.
The charity is Christ-centered, providing scripture in the children's own language and introducing them to Jesus as their savior.
The sponsored children have the opportunity to attend a project at a local church, where they receive education, socialize with other children, and are protected from unnecessary child labor.
The impact of sponsorships including over 4,300 hours spent in projects, nearly 1,500 nutritious meals provided, 24 medical checkups, and eight scriptures given to the children.
The countries where the sponsored children reside are Africa, Central and South America.
Additional financial support and gifts given by the church with examples of how these gifts have made a significant difference in the lives of the sponsored children and their families.
The personal connection between sponsors and children key, as is the exchange of letters and the profound impact it has on both the children and sponsors.

the overwhelming love of God

18:42 - 28:00 - Introduction and reading
18:42 - 25:26 - Introduction for all ages: ‘tired?’
Tiredness is a common experience for everyone, including children and adults.
Tiredness can be caused by various factors, such as physical exertion, work, boredom, or lack of sleep.
Rest and renewal are necessary for maintaining energy and motivation.
Isaiah describes God as the Everlasting One who never grows tired or weary.
Trusting in God can lead to renewed strength and spiritual vitality.
Those who rely on God for help will find their weaknesses uplifted and their strength restored.
The imagery of rising on wings like eagles symbolizes gaining a new perspective and transcending daily struggles.
Even though eagles may not be present in the local area, the concept of being lifted by a powerful bird can be inspiring.
God's ability to lift and carry us signifies the potential for divine support and guidance.
Reflecting on the image of a red kite soaring in the sky can remind us of God's capacity to uplift and renew us.

36:44 - 39:14 - Hymn TP 81- Spirit of God

39:24 - 51:04 - Short Address
Trinity Sunday marks the culmination of the Christian year, reflecting on the journey from Advent to Easter and beyond.
Our church is named Trinity Church, emphasizing the unity and diversity of God's nature.
The disciples worshiped Jesus, recognizing him as both truly human and divine.
Doubts and questions are allowed in the journey of faith, and there is room for sceptics within the church.
Jesus declares his authority over heaven and earth, bridging the divide between the divine and human realms.
The commission is given to spread the universal message of God's love to all people.
The message is for everyone - all backgrounds, all sexualities, all races, and all religions.
Baptism is a way to immerse people in the love of God and introduce them to the lifestyle of following Jesus.
Learning and obedience are essential in deepening our understanding of what it means to follow Jesus.
Jesus promises to be with us always, even though unseen, and provides tangible signs of his presence in the sacraments.
The worship concludes with gratitude and assurance that Jesus is with us until the end of the age.

14:39 - 16:09 - Reading: Psalm 104:24-34, 35b NIVUK
read by Lesley Bogart

24 How many are your works, LORD!
    In wisdom you made them all;
    the earth is full of your creatures.
25  There is the sea, vast and spacious,
    teeming with creatures beyond number –
    living things both large and small.
26  There the ships go to and fro,
    and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
27  All creatures look to you
    to give them their food at the proper time.
28  When you give it to them,
    they gather it up;
when you open your hand,
    they are satisfied with good things.
29  When you hide your face,

    they are terrified;
when you take away their breath,
    they die and return to the dust.
30  When you send your Spirit,
    they are created,
    and you renew the face of the ground.
31  May the glory of the LORD endure for ever;
    may the LORD rejoice in his works –
32  he who looks at the earth, and it trembles,
    who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
33  I will sing to the LORD all my life;
    I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
34  May my meditation be pleasing to him,
    as I rejoice in the LORD.
35b  Praise the LORD, my soul.
Praise the LORD.

The churches in different areas would come together, accompanied by uniformed groups and bands, to march in a procession towards the park for celebrations. 
The event included singing, pageantry, and the crowning of a queen. 
It was a significant and joyful gathering that brought people together to celebrate something meaningful to everyone involved. 
Reflecting on the nostalgia and the sense of community and togetherness that characterized the event

35:04 - 38:21 - Hymn R&amp;S 489 – Be Thou my vision

38:29 - 56:57 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection
&quot;Welcoming Each Wonder&quot; by Tom Gordon.
A boy named Nathan and his questions about God.
Nathan asks his grandmother about what God is like and how he can be present even though he can't be seen.
His grandmother uses the analogy of soap slipping out of one's hands to explain the presence of God.
Nathan realizes that God, like the soap, can disappear but always comes back.
The story highlights the idea that God is always there, even if we can't see Him, and we just know when He is present.
The work of Wycliffe Bible translators and the importance of translating the Bible into native languages.
The story encourages sharing our experience of God in a language that others can understand.
A reminder that the spirit of God is always speaking to us, even if we may not always be listening.

The theme of the service is forgiveness and renewal.
Sharing their thoughts on forgiveness.
Forgiveness is explained as apologizing to someone after being rude and them forgiving you.
Examples of situations that require forgiveness are discussed, such as being hurt or having something damaged.
Forgiveness is acknowledged as a difficult process, both for individuals and for God.
The reading from Zechariah in the Old Testament illustrates God's forgiveness towards the Israelite people after their exile in Babylon.
The Lord's Prayer emphasises the importance of forgiving others as we ask for God's forgiveness.
Humans are not deserving of God's forgiveness, but God's mercy allows for forgiveness when we recognize our mistakes and are truly sorry.
The challenge of genuinely being sorry when seeking forgiveness.
The significance of forgiveness in the service's theme of forgiveness and renewal.

17:00 - 18:51 - Hymn - In Christ there is no east or west
[Tune: St Bernard] 

18:57 - 33:44 - Sermon
The prophet Zechariah, along with Ezra and Nehemiah, facilitated the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple after the Jews' return from Exile in Babylon.
The temple rebuilding was delayed due to local politics and opposition from the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Persian king Atasurpses.
After 20 years, the people were reminded of their identity as God's chosen people and were motivated to rebuild the temple.
The prophet Zechariah announces God's word and emphasizes the urgency for action and restoration.
God promises to restore safety and good fortune to the people of Jerusalem, bringing peace and blessings.
Despite ongoing challenges and injustices in the world, God remains present and offers salvation through Jesus Christ.
The Book of Revelation, written by John, provides encouragement to the persecuted Christians and reassurance of God's ultimate purpose.
Accepting the Water of Life offered by Jesus symbolizes spiritual sustenance and eternal life.
The teachings from these ancient texts remind us of the unchanging nature of human beings, God's faithfulness, and the opportunity for personal restoration and renewal through forgiveness and faith.
The world is characterized by difficulties, inequalities, injustices, and the actions of bossy, greedy individuals who cause harm to others.
Through embracing the teachings and life of Jesus Christ, individuals can experience personal restoration, renewal, and have their names written in the book of the Lamb.

37:54 - 46:53 - Short Address
Different people in the church have varying reactions to the coronation ceremony.
Some appreciate the colorful uniforms, vestments, and rituals, while others prefer something simpler.
There is a mix of emotions, including discomfort when the ritual becomes disconnected from Jesus on the cross.
King Charles, like any human being, experienced nervousness and anxiety during the anointing.
The greater truth of the ceremony is that Jesus is exalted above all, and every knee should bow to him.
The readings draw us into the wonder of who Jesus is and how he brings us to the Divine reality.
&quot;God Save the King&quot; reminds us that we all need saving, and God has a part to play in our nation.
King Charles has a representative role that goes beyond politics and arguments.
The speaker hopes that King Charles will preserve the nation's laws and diversity.
The letter of Peter reminds us to draw spiritual sustenance from God's love.
The sharing of the Lord's Supper reminds us that we all need sustenance and to draw close to God.
We carry burdens on our shoulders, but we can come to God's table to be sustained.
The Lord is good, and we can taste that goodness and carry it with us.
All the time, God is good, and we can draw close to Jesus to experience his goodness.

09:17 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle

10:45 - Call to worship
Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth.
Worship the LORD with gladness;
Come before God with joyful songs.
Know that the LORD is God.
It is God who made us, and we are his; ;
we are God’s people, the sheep of his pasture.
Enter God’s gates with thanksgiving
and his courts with praise;
Give thanks to God and praise his name.
God’s love endures forever.

11:31 - 13:15 - Hymn - I will enter his gates (sung twice)

13:23 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

15:46 - 24:54 - Introduction for all ages: ‘Recognise that voice?’
Missing Easter at Trinity due to scheduling conflicts.
During Good Friday, the church had stations of prayer, including one titled &quot;The Buried Grain,&quot; where people were invited to plant a pinch of seed into a tray of soil.
This links to the Bible verse where Jesus compares his death to a buried grain that produces new life.
The speaker sees the growth of the planted seeds as a symbol of Jesus' love within us, reverberating down the centuries and producing fruit in the lives of billions of people.
The Bee Squared program (https://zeroch.org/bee-squared/) that encourages people to plant wildflowers to support bees and other insects crucial to life.
Jesus is referred to as the Good Shepherd and the gateway to God's loving presence.
Jesus' sheep recognize and trust his voice, and the speaker asks the audience to think of a voice they trust, like Mary Berry's recipe or Winston Churchill's wartime speeches.
There are many voices out there today, and the speaker urges the audience to choose which voices they trust.


Reading: John 10.1 – 10 NIVUK read by Kitty 

27:49 - Prayer
Lord you are the Way – help us to follow.
You are the truth – help us to listen.
You are the Life – refresh our lives today. Amen.

28:24 - 30:23 - Hymn - Jesus stand among us

30:44 - 31:33 - Reading: Psalm 23 NIVUK read by Kate 

31:41 - 39:44 - Meditation on the 23 rd Psalm – ‘being a follower of the Good
Shepherd’ (using Stuart Townend sung version MP 1008)

Jesus offers us, life in abundance.
(pause, then sing the chorus)

protection from harm.
(pause, then sing the chorus)

40:21 - 41:26 - Reading: John 10.11 – 16 NIVUK read by Kitty

42:06 - 43:17 - Hymn The King of love vs 1 and 6 only -sung seated

43:54 - 56:30 - Address
The Great &quot;I ams&quot;
Jesus describes himself as &quot;I am&quot; seven times in John's Gospel.
Each description (&quot;I am the Good Shepherd,&quot; &quot;I am the bread of life,&quot; etc.) takes us into the heart of who Jesus is.
&quot;I am&quot; is not just a personal description but echoes God's words to Moses in the desert.
In John's Gospel, &quot;I am&quot; is linked to the fundamentals of life.
The Shepherd lies down in front of the entrance and protects the sheep through the night.
This intimate picture of the Shepherd is full of trust and care.
Jesus is the Good Shepherd who knows us through and through and wants to protect and keep us safe.
The Gate is the cross, where Jesus protects, leads, and opens up heaven and God's love to us.
Jesus is both the king of kings and the outcast, the one who is poor and rejected.


56:44 - 58:33 - Hymn- All heaven declares

58:41 - 01:05:55 - Prayers for the world with the response
God of truth and love,
bring them abundant life.

01:06:14 - 01:09:32 - Hymn - Christ is the King! O friends rejoice

01:09:33 - 01:09:58 - Closing blessing

Jesus walking with the disciples, hidden in plain sight.
Jesus was not noticed by the disciples when he was walking with them.

We should be open to expecting the unexpected.
We should pray for those who are struggling.
We should have faith in God, even when things don't go our way. The story of the Road to Emmaus shows how Jesus can come alongside us in unexpected ways, and give us hope when we are struggling.

19:27 - Opening Prayers

22:04 - 24:40 - Reading: John 20. 1 – 18 NIVUK 

24:53 - 30:04 - Talk for all ages
Eggs have been given during this time of year before Christianity because it represents new life in spring.
Jesus' new life is different from a physical life because he is outside of time and space.
To change and experience new life, one must break out of their shell, just as a chick must peck out of an egg.
God calls us to live a loving life and trust in Him, which may require breaking out of our old habits and fears.
Jesus has already broken through death and sin, and through Him, we can find a new life.
The Easter message is that Jesus' resurrection brings new life and the possibility of eternal life.

30:14 - 32:44 - Hymn R&amp;S 246: The day of resurrection

33:12 - 34:46 - Reading: Acts 10. 34 – 43 NIVUK read by Sarah and Samuel Evans

The power of first impressions.
A TV advert that illustrates the importance of getting the full picture before making judgments.
First impressions can lead to error and prejudice.
The Easter story and the power of first impressions.
Mary Magdalene's initial impression upon finding the empty tomb was reasonable.
Peter and John rushed to verify Mary's report but only saw that the body was gone.
Mary stayed at the tomb and encountered Jesus again.
The wonder and mystery of the Resurrection are beyond human understanding.
Waiting on God and risking vulnerability can lead to a deeper understanding of truth.
The truth of the Resurrection is that Jesus Christ is risen.

07:30 - Introduction and call to worship (from Isaiah 53 and John 1.29)

He was despised and rejected  a man of suffering and
acquainted with grief; he was despised, and held of no
account.

All: Yet he was wounded for our transgressions,
crushed for our iniquities;

Upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by
his bruises we are healed. All we like sheep have gone
astray; we have all turned to our own way,
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

Behold the lamb of God who takes away
the sin of the world.
Thanks be to God for the cross of Christ,
Sign of God’s love for the world.
We offer our thanks and praise
this good and holy day. Amen.

Palm crosses are a symbol of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem because they are made from palm leaves, which were used to welcome Jesus into the city.
Palm crosses are a symbol of victory because they represent Jesus' victory over death.
Palm crosses are a reminder of Jesus' suffering and death because they represent the cross that Jesus was crucified on.
Palm crosses are a symbol of hope and new life because they represent Jesus' resurrection.
Palm crosses can be recycled or composted because they are made from natural materials.
WaterAid is a charity that provides clean water and sanitation to people in need around the world.
Sado is a girl from Ethiopia who had to walk five hours to collect water every day because she lived in a village that did not have access to clean water.
Malala is a girl from Madagascar who can now go to school because of a water tap in her village. The water tap was installed by WaterAid.
Palm crosses are a symbol of our connection to the world church and to people in need around the world because they are made by people in Tanzania and used by Christians all over the world.

Taizé chant: ‘We adore you, Lord Jesus Christ’ (recording)

A prayer for all ages together

Reading: Philippians 2.5-11 NIVUK read by Norma
 
44:38 - 46:15 - Hymn - My song is love unknown (vs. 1 and 2 only)
46:25 - Prayer

46:56 - 55:33 - Short Address
You don't need a long sermon, you just need a Palm Cross to connect you with the world church
A palm cross connects us with the World Church and with the crowd that welcomed Jesus on Palm Sunday.
The crowd that welcomed Jesus was a mixture of people, some curious, some caught up in the Jesus movement, and some who wanted something new.
Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was a protest against the way things were, with Roman and religious authorities pressing down on the people.
Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was also a celebration of an alternative way of life, based on love and justice.
The crowd welcomed Jesus with palm branches and cloaks, symbolizing their willingness to lay down their lives for him.
Jesus's death on the cross was a sacrifice for the sins of the world and a victory over hatred and division.
We are called to follow Jesus's example of humility, love, and forgiveness.
We are called to work for justice and peace in the world.
Palm Sunday is a time to reflect on the meaning of Jesus's life and death and to commit ourselves to following him.
Palm Sunday is a time to celebrate the hope and joy that Jesus brings to the world.
