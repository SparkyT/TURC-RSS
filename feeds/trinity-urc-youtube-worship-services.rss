00:00:00 - Music before the service
07:43 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able),

07:53 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

09:37 - Call to worship

10:27 - 12:22 - Hymn - R&amp;S 565 Jesus stand among us

12:25 - Prayer of adoration
14:17 - Lord‚Äôs Prayer

15:00 - 28:18 - Introduction for all ages: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äô
Material for the week prepared by Christians in Burkina Faso focused on the Good Samaritan parable and loving your neighbor. 
Burkina Faso is experiencing major unrest and terrorism, with over 2 million displaced people.
Links to a couple previously held hostage there that we prayed for. 
The importance of welcoming others, like Abraham and Sarah showing hospitality to angel visitors. Ways to welcome include providing refreshments and making people comfortable.


28:48 - 30:05 - Reading: Genesis 18:1-8 Good News

WORSHIP SONGS
31:22 - MP 1221 Praise is rising
34:39 - MP 1046 Give thanks to the Lord our God and King

37:50 - Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place
(and we share a blessing ‚Äì the Lord be with you; and
also with you) or there are activities at back of church.

39:08 - 40:26 - Reading: Psalm 138 NIVUK read by Kitty Bird

40:36 - Prayer of confession with the response
Merciful God: forgive and heal us.

44:07 - 46:45 - Reading: Luke 10:25-37 NIVUK read by Larry Ogbewe

47:17 - Hymn - R&amp;S 309 Spirit of the Living God move among us

48:33 - 01:00:32 - Address - The Transforming Power of Love for Neighbour
The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us the meaning of loving our neighbor
The Good Samaritan went far beyond what was expected to care for the wounded stranger
We should not just pass by those in need but stop and truly help
Unity and reconciliation are needed in divided communities like Burkina Faso
Christians there are working together across denominations to help displaced people
We must have hope - &quot;the moment of reconciliation will come&quot;
The command to love God and neighbor matters more than religious laws and debates
We must move from seeing &quot;neighbor&quot; as a noun to becoming a neighbor through action
We can collaborate to be Good Samaritans addressing desperation in our own communities
Love never ends - it bears, believes, hopes and endures all things
Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan, focusing on the Samaritan's loving action towards the wounded stranger. This radical care for neighbor should inspire Christians today, even in divided communities, to work together in reconciliation and service. 

01:00:33 - Affirmation of Love (verses from 1 Corinthians 13)

01:03:18 - 01:05:31 - Hymn - R&amp;S 648 Jesu, Jesu fill us with your love

01:05:33 - 01:09:37 - Prayers of intercession with the response
Fill us with your love: make us one in you.

01:10:57 - Closing Prayer (from the Daily Prayer for Christian Unity
of the Chemin Neuf Community)
Lord Jesus, who prayed that all might be one,
we pray to you for the unity of all Christians,
according to your will, according to your means.
May your Spirit enable us to experience
the suffering caused by division,
to see our sin and to hope beyond all hope. Amen.

01:11:58 - 01:14:02 - Hymn R&amp;S 647 In Christ there is no East or West

01:14:03 - 01:14:28 - Blessing

01:14:55 - 01:18:34 - Music after the service
