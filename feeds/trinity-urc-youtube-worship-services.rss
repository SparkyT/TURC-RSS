35:54 - Hymn R&amp;S 474 Brother, sister let me serve you

38:50 - 52:45 - Short Address: ‘Jesus – the anointed one’
The journey of Lent this year has been overshadowed by the horrific invasion of Ukraine
The world feels a darker and more fragile place
So we turn to the story of Jesus that can speak powerfully into our situation today
He lived in an occupied nation where a brutal regime imposed its power by force, crucifying thousands as a demonstration of strength
People of faith questioned why God had not liberated them
Injustice and corruption were rife
Into this chaos came Jesus, his integrity shone through confronting the authorities, challenging the religious leaders. For many, God was a small tribal God but Jesus introduced a God whose love knew no limit
Sometimes the weight of that ministry must have been too heavy to bear - sometimes he withdrew to Bethany to the homes of friends Martha and Mary.
According to John it was here he was anointed with precious oil.
In Luke the story appears earlier
For John, the anointing of Jesus, preparing him for all that is to come happens in a safe space in the home of friends.
Jesus stands up for Mary, refusing to allow her to be bullied by Judas.
&quot;You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me&quot;
Today, we need to stand up for those who are bullied or oppressed.  That is what Jesus does for each one of us, for all humanity

58:58 - Prayer of confession
Forgive us, faithful God,
when we fill the rooms we enter with negativity, not warmth:
Forgive us, and fill us with love.
Forgive us when we justify our reluctance to give and share,
blaming others rather than ourselves:
Forgive us, and fill us with love
Forgive us when we are slow to express gratitude,
and take what we have for granted.
Forgive us, and fill us with love.
In the name of the anointed One, Jesus Christ. Amen.
Be assured in the name of Jesus: Our sins are forgiven; we can
begin again, renewed by God’s Spirit. Thanks be to God. Amen.

Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says, “Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.” 7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent

13:03 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle
15:18 - Call to worship (1 John 4. 7,9,11)
Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from
God. God showed his love for us by sending his only Son into the
world, that we might have life through him. If this is how God
loved us, then we should love one another.

15:52 - Hymn -  R&amp;S 30 Father we love you,

18:25 - Opening Prayer

20:38 - Introduction: ‘who do you say I am?’
Welcome as we continue our Lenten journey
We are beginning to relax some of our restrictions
Those at home won't see that we have tables out to help share our worship today
Our theme through Lent is to focus on Jesus and to answer the question he asked his followers - &quot;who do you say I am&quot;
How would you picture Jesus?
At the last supper Leonardo Da Vinci (1498), Christ Carrying the Cross byt El Greco (1580), Christ of St John of the Cross Salvador Dali (1951), Light of the World William Holman Hunt (1851), The Last Supper by Stanley Spencer Cookham (1920), The Found Life of Jesus Mafa (1970s), Christ on the Tube

30:53 - Reading Luke Luke 9.18 – 22 

31:55 - 33:20 - Talk and activity: Jesus today
3 names or descriptions of Jesus (1st Important in the Christian
faith; 2nd Personal – your favourite description and 3rd a more
unusual name or description).

42:28 - 42:53 - A Prayer to Jesus

42:55 - Worship songs - MP 375 Jesus, name above all names
R&amp;S 271 You are the King of Glory

47:25 - Reading: Luke 8. 19 – 21 

47:59 - 52-55 - Talk: being part of the family of Jesus - keep practicing
Does the reading sound harsh for Jesus' family?
In a sense he was turning his back on them, challenging the concept of family as a small, exclusive group, moving to a wider family with God
We draw back from that - blood is thicker than water.
For some, family is an immensely enriching experience, for others it's the opposite
Jesus says all of this has to be put in a new perspective - you are part of my family.  Hear my words and put them into practice
Jesus looks at each one of us and says those who have heard God's word, put them into practice
Mothering Sunday next week
Honoring those women who take care of us
Linking to the whole church family across the world - Hong Kong, Yemen, America, South Africa

53:10 - Activity: making cards to give to members of this church family
Write their name here and pray for them this week

01:04:21 - Offering and Commitment prayer
Lord Jesus we offer our gifts and talents
for your work today
May your love and truth
Guide and inspire our lives now and always. Amen.

15:50 - Hymn R&amp;S 38: Thou whose almighty word

18:30 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

21:45 - Reading  Luke 13 vv 31 – 35 read by Sparks family

22:50 - 26:55 - All age Introduction 
We seems to be bombarded with special offers wherever we go
If we like it, we'll go for it.
Sometimes it's too good to be true
We have the choice to take advantage or not
Jesus' special offer to us is very good value - letting us live life to the full not just now but forever and how much does it cost us - nothing.  Jesus has already paid the full price
In our reading we see Jesus sad - longing to give his people the love they need to make their lives a whole lot richer
Does it seem too good to be true?  Are we not worthy of the offer.  Why do many humans say &quot;no thanks&quot; and miss out on the wonderful life God can give?

27:03 - Hymns &amp;Worship songs 
R&amp;S 363: Lord Jesus think on me
Purify my heart MP921
 
33:05 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:

33:15 - 34:35 - Reading: Jeremiah 2 vv 30 – 37  read by Sparks family

34:45 - Hymn R&amp;S 522: From heaven you came helpless babe

39:20 - 55:28 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
Supporting the national centre for Epilepsy in Chalfont Common
Hearing negative talk about the development of the centre &quot;we don't need any more of that sort&quot;
Most people are supportive and want to applaud those who help but this changes once they find out the halfway house will help criminals or the mentally ill
What was once a good idea is rejected because it is happening next door
What causes this - is it fear, for them or their children, is it financial?
Jeremiah faces the rejection and wrath of the people but still speaks what God has told him to say
Our Lord is for ever loving and gracious

56:14 - Hymn R&amp;S 620: For the healing of the nations

59:08 - Prayers of intersession

Offering  Prayer of Dedication

01:06:02 - Hymn R&amp;S262: Crown him with many crowns

00:11:00 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)
13:00 -Call to worship 
As we come to worship today let us say of our God:
You are the One who is my refuge and my fortress, 
my God, in whom I trust.  
Lord open our lips
And our mouths shall proclaim your praise! 

13:40 - Song - R&amp;S 292  When morning gilds the skies

16:58 - 19:00 - Prayer of adoration and confession 

19:04 - Introduction: ‘Into Lent’
Ashing services at the start of Lent
&quot;From dust you came, to dust you will return.  Turn from your sins and turn to Christ&quot;
Think about names that are important in life today?  Zelenskyy, Hope, Gary, Brian, Tracey, David, Greta, Pat, Tintin
Our names are important to us
The most important name and the answer to all questions in all age talks - Jesus
Asking &quot;who is Jesus to us and what does it mean to follow Jesus today?&quot;
H.G.Wells -  &quot;I am an historian, I am not a believer, but I must confess as a historian that this penniless preacher from Nazareth is irrevocably the very center of history. Jesus Christ is easily the most dominant figure in all history.&quot;
The Son of God and the Son of Man
Jesus wanted to be close to humanity

27:34 - 28:47 - Reading: Romans 10.8b – 13 (Good News) 

29:30 - 35:57 - Song - TP 102 You laid aside your majesty, MP 477 - My Peace I Give Unto You

37:01 - 38:40 - Reading: Luke 4.1-13 NIVUK read by Lesley Bogart

38:50 - 56:00 - Short Address: ‘Jesus – Son of God, Son of Man’
It's a vivid picture and story of Jesus and the Devil.
Wrestling with evil in the wilderness
The struggle between the two has echoed down through history
The struggle between good and evil, love and hate, life and death
We see it played out in the messy world of politics and most recently in the situation in Ukraine
We pray that efforts to arrange a ceasefire bear fruit
Of course it's not just played out &quot;out there&quot;, it's played out within ourselves
Too often we try to help ourselves at the expense of others
Even the church in Russia has played its part in a mythology that Ukraine is part of Mother Russia
We pray that Patriarch Kirill will speak out against the violence.
We are caught up in this, it's not just about others.
We pray that further escalation in Ukraine can be avoided

56:02 - 59:55 - Worship Song from Ukraine 
“I will Sing,” by Maria Kuchurian &amp; Diana Yakovyn

He is the One who lifts up and surrounds with peace.
His love is great! I will hold on to Him.
When the heart is heavy, He takes away the stone,
Gently hugs. O my holy Jesus!
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing to the Risen King!
His hand is with me. He's near, here, I know
I feel in my heart, I pray to Him!
He warms with love and wipes away tears
Loyal Friend forever. His name is Jesus!
You chose me and set me up, You chose me, raised me up!
You chose me and forgave me, You chose me, raised me!
You chose me and filled me, You chose me, raised me!

59:59 - 01:04:22 - Prayer for peace in Ukraine
The psalmist writes: “I call on the Lord in my distress,
and he answers me.”
Lord, we call to you in our distress.
We trust you to answer us.
We lift up the people of Ukraine before you…

Lord’s Prayer

WE APPROACH GOD

07:35 - Entry of the bible and lighting of the peace candle
09:00 - Call to worship – based on Matthew 5 and Luke 6 
Blest are the poor in spirit, 
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Blest are they that mourn, 
For they shall be comforted. 
Blest are the meek,
For they shall inherit the earth.

09:51 - Hymn - R&amp;S 339 – Great God, your love has called us here. 
 -
14:25 Introduction
15:25 - PRAYERS - of Approach, Thanksgiving, Confession &amp;  Praise     
LORD'S PRAYER
-
20:27 - 25:30 - FAMILY TALK – In search of happiness
Who knows Timpson's?
A well known, family run business.
Run with great integrity.
They have just appointed a director of happiness.
What makes you happy? Arguing about one's age?
Family and friends, Lego spaceships, sunshine, sweets, ice cream, friends
The next question - what makes your parents happy?
A tidy room? Space and time?
The real question - what makes God happy?
We can get an understanding of this when we read the Beatitudes
Those who are humble, not constantly taking selfies, merciful, not vengeful, those who work for peace, not trying to conquer lands 

-
25:33 - Hymn 2 – R&amp;S 512 – Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
-
28:53 - OFFERTORY PRAYER 
-
PRAYER for young people as they leave
 May the Lord be with you
 And also with you
-
29:57 - WE LISTEN FOR GOD’S WORD
-
31:39 - Reading 1 – Jeremiah 17 v5-10
-
33:03 - 36:18 - Reading 2 - Luke 6 v17-26
-
36:28 - Hymn 3 - R&amp;S 586 – All my hope on God is founded.
- 
40:18 - 55:30 - SERMON – Jam tomorrow?
An amusing story about the last hymn (All my hope on God is founded)
This service was first used at Chesham a couple of weeks ago. Chesham have some masonry fallen off one of the towers.
As the hymn was sung, most of the Elders were struggling not to giggle as the words &quot;with what care and toil is build-ed, tower and temple fall to dust&quot; rang out
Do you remember more than a decade ago when David Cameron asked the Office for National Statistics to come up with a happiness index?
The sermon on the mount and sermon on the plain having the same roots, extending into the Old Testament
Listeners to Christ would have known the links and known that Jesus was referring back to Chronicles, Psalms, and Isaiah.
Luke presents us with a choice - do you want to be a citizen of God's kingdom or a citizen of the Roman Empire (or whatever empire is around today)?
Do you want to be generous or greedy, merciful or vengeful, peaceful or militant, part of the solution or part of the problem
May we live full lives in this topsy turvy world
-
WE MAKE OUR RESPONSE
-
55:45 - Hymn 4 - R&amp;S 367 – I want to walk with Jesus Christ.

What makes you feel empowered?  Think of moments that have caused you to feel confidence or courage to step up.
2 years ago I felt empowered by the technical team to speak to people in their homes - scary and creative!
When have you felt dis-empowered?
If Hayley were here she would share how she was empowered to help people
Memories of a woman at a market begging people to help feed her children
Becoming aware of Compassion through her church
Pen pals to share stories and help
Feeling the need to help but not knowing where to do so
How to be part of a sustainable, God built change
Empowering people to do it the right way
Jesus is the original example of empowering others

08:26 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle

10:43 - Call to worship 

12:21 - Hymn MP 564 Praise to the Lord

15:51 - Intro to theme – The story of Robin Hood
Many versions of the story of Robin Hood
Disney Fox through Errol Flynn, Richard Green
A Saxon lord, made outlaw, gains the trust of the poor, falls in love, wins an archery contest, defeats the bad guys and live happily ever after until being betrayed by his sister.
A great story with many changes over the times
A love interest
Robin and most of the outlaws are Saxons but all of the power is transferring to the conquering Normans.
They unfairly use their power against the people
We know that if there is going to be justice that the law needs to be applied equally to all
Imagine you were a nobleman hearing the story for the first time, or a peasant or a priest.  How would you feel about it?
Positive or negative - generally the lower in the pecking order, the more positive
When we hear the passage from Luke's gospel later, listen and imagine the different reactions that people might have

21:22 - 24:26 - Opening Prayers 
The Lord’s Prayer
 
24:27 - Worship song  MP 1201 Longing for light
 
29:49 - Introduction to Bible readings

30:30 - Reading: Jeremiah 17:5-10 read by Norma Garden

31:54 - 33:47 - Reading: Luke 6:17-26 read by Norma Garden

33:58 - Hymn MP 16 All my hope on God is founded

36:57 - 51:20 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
We are very used to hearing a comfortable gospel message
One of peace, a loving God sending his Son to forgive our sins, Jesus raising on the third day, how at the end of time he will return to judge the living and the dead.  
Most of it is fairly nice and cosy, but should it be that comfortable?
From the passage in Luke, Jesus tells of those who will be blessed
After the blessings come the sorrows: those of the rich, fat and prosperous.  Those who laugh now, those who are praised by the crowds.
Remember the story of Robin Hood, how you feel depends on where you fit into the story.
If you are sorrowful, how do you feel if God tells you that you are blessed in the next life?
The bible has a lot to say about justice
It's God's word and we should love justice because God loves justice
Racism and wider justice issues deny basic human dignity to men and women made in the image of God
However, God is a just God.  

51:27 - Hymn MP 1261 Brother, Sister, let me serve you

54:29 - Prayers for the world

59:34 - Hymn MP 77 Christ triumphant

18:46 - Song - R&amp;S 34  Holy, holy, holy

22:20 - Prayer of adoration and confession 

24:30 - Introduction: ‘ready for new challenges?’
Already in February, January has gone like a dream
Thinking of new challenges like those faced by Isaiah or Simon Peter
Are you ready for new challenges?  A new system at work, GCSE choices, driving test, making soft rolls.
Challenges faced by Nina Sparks as she gained a position on the GB para snowboard team, representing her country at the World Para Snowsports championships in Lillehammer 
Staff shortages in schools due to COVID
Cancer Research London Winter run 2022
God's word of challenge in the bible
Our two readings this morning will have those words of challenge
God's challenge to Isiah, &quot;who shall I send?&quot;
An all church challenge - walking with Jesus

34:26 - 35:42 - Prayer for all ages
Jesus wants us to get involved in God’s story. So, I ask you:
Are we ready to listen to Jesus?
  Yes, we are ready.
Are we ready to learn new ways of living?
  Yes, we are ready.
Are we ready to use our skills and gifts to help others?
  Yes, we are ready.
Are we ready to say thank you to Jesus,
for being our friend and Saviour?
  Yes, we are ready.
Let’s say it again!
  Yes, we are ready.

35:44 - Song MP 3 Abba Father let me be

38:12 - 40:53 - Reading: Isaiah 6.1-8 

40:55 - Hymn - MP 857   I the Lord of sea and sky

46:33 - Reading: Luke 5.1-11NIVUK 

48:50 - Short Address: ‘called to go deeper’
Building and launching a yacht at Lyme Regis
Circumnavigating the British Isles, beautiful and frightening
The ferocity of the sea
The story of the net washing, the teaching, and the huge catch
Using his boat brought Simon into contact with this amazing man Jesus
Ultimately the fish are not important as Jesus is talking about fishing for people
Simon recognizes his own failures in the presence of this extraordinary figure
Jesus says not for the last time - &quot;do not be afraid, follow me&quot;
After the assurance becomes the invitation to become a fisher of people
Are we willing to follow?  To the table, to our daily life, to our hurting life.  To draw others into the net of God's grace

59:48 - 01:00:42 - Prayer  

01:00:50 - Offering our lives for God’s work today 

Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at church (or at home) united in the name of Christ.

01:02:09 - Song - MP 50 Be still for the presence of the Lord

33:00 - 54:05 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection 
Sharing pulpits
Living and growing up in Southall
Jesus living the words from Isiah &quot;the spirit of the Lord is upon me&quot;
The symbolism of sitting down after the reading
Jesus showing how people had benefited from Gods presence in their lives
&quot;Who is this Jesus to say these things!&quot;
Times when God has called us to speak yet we remain silent
Would you have been one of the crowd in the synagogue?
When did we last speak to friends or family about our faith?
Where does God want us to go, what does He want us to say and to whom?

30:29 - Hymn RS 745 A new commandment I give unto you
Led by the worship band

33:18 - 44:15 - Sermon followed by time of quiet reflection
Our relationship with God
Nehemiah was written in the 5th Century BC by the same author as the Chronicles and Ezra
These books are important as they tell the history of the Jews up to the end of their 50 years of exile in Babylon and their return
Rebuilding the temple which was destroyed
 Fast forward to AD 55.  The Persian empire has given way to the Greeks and Romans, Jesus has been born, crucified and risen from the dead. Saul had made his journey and been blinded by the light, meeting Christ.
From that moment on, nothing was the same.  Saul became Paul, realising Jesus was the messiah he had been waiting for all his life.
Paul felt God meets us just where we are
Nearly 2000 years later, the same applies to us

44:29 - Hymn R&amp;S 353 There’s a wideness in God’s mercy

47:42 - Prayers of intercession

08:12 - Call to worship (based on Isaiah 60)
We are met in the presence of God;
and we do not meet alone.
With the Church throughout the world,
we gather to worship the Lord.
In Cathedrals, tin tabernacles and fields,
God’ holy name is praised. 
And here with our hearts and our voices,
God’ holy name is praised. 
We are met in the presence of God;
and we do not meet alone.

11:58 - Prayers of adoration and confession 
Lord’s Prayer 

14:21 - Introduction: ‘Jesus revealed’
Today is the second Sunday in Epiphany
Not as familiar as Easter or Lent but still one of the great seasons
Thinking about hidden things
Snowdrops, daffodils, the promise of things to come
Anyone can count the seeds in an apple but only God can count the number of apples in a seed
Jesus revealed
The wedding in Cana
6x 120 litres of wine!


22:41 - 24:10 - Reading: John 2. 1 – 11

24:12 - 26:03 - Prayer
When a daffodil or the first snowdrop comes into bloom:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When the sun is rising, or the sun is setting:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When a baby is born, or a chick is hatched:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When we feel the warm embrace of a family hug:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When we come to worship or offer a prayer:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
Transforming God, wherever we are, whatever we do,
whether we are at home, work or school,
help us to see the miracle in the ordinary,
and to catch a glimpse of your glory in our midst.  
Amen.

Focusing on today in 3 different ways
This Sunday first marks the second Sunday of Epiphany with Jesus being revealed
John says not to get fixated on the details like the huge amount of wine, but to treat this as a sign of when glory was first revealed
Allow the story to reveal to you something extraordinary in the light of God's love
Corinthian Christians lived in an amazing and diverse court. They were sometimes carried away with religious fervour.

This year may we continue to pray for unity in the Church of Christ

 But now thus says the Lord, 
 he who created you, O Jacob,
 he who formed you, O Israel:
 Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
 I have called you by name, you are mine.
 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
 and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;
 when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,
 and the flame shall not consume you.
 For I am the Lord your God,
 the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour.


21:07 - Hymn: R&amp;S 589  How firm a foundation

24:43 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

27:45 - 36:12 - Talk for all ages :  Life changing moments
How are you feeling this morning?  We all have ups and downs over time.
Sometimes we need things to lift us
Do you agree or disagree on these things that might lift you:
A good meal? A bar of chocolate? A run? A bottle of water?
Being with family
Pets
All of these things can lift us but they aren't permanent answers. We need something deeper to give us a boost when life changes direction.
Speaking to God and Him speaking to us
Looking at moments in Jesus' life - his baptism when God recognised him and sent him on into his ministry
Moments in his life when God speaks

36:44 - Worship songs 
R&amp;S 308/309 Spirit of the Living God
MP 465  Meekness and Majesty

 Adults: May the Lord be with you
 Junior Church: And also with you
 All: Amen

44:25 - Introduction to Bible readings

45:55 - Reading: Luke 3: 15-22   read by John Hillson
15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 16 John answered them all, ‘I baptise you with[b] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptise you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire. 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.’ 18 And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.
19 But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done, 20 Herod added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.
21 When all the people were being baptised, Jesus was baptised too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened 22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: ‘You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.’



48:20 - Reading: Acts 8: 14-17  read by Sue Thorne
14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria. 15 When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 16 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

49:22 - Hymn:  R&amp;S 180  Before the world began


52:56 - 01:12:34 - Sermon:  We are loved 
We have God's affirmation of Christ at his baptism.
It's in all 4 gospels, two of which start with this story
John and Jesus were cousins, John just a few months older who as a young man went to live in the wilderness in very harsh conditions
John was preparing people for Jesus
The bible never suggests Jesus baptises with water, always with the laying on of hands
It always sounds simple - Jesus arrives, asks to be baptised, John is reluctant but agrees, performs the act, the spirit comes down.
Why did God choose this moment to speak
It contains much of the mystery and wonder of God
Why did Jesus need to be baptised?
Glimpses of hope and love all around us
We need to trust and look for God to find strength

Unconditional love
Archbishop Desmond Tutu speaking about respect and love for all

01:13:10 - Hymn:  R&amp;S 413  What a friend we have in Jesus

01:16:30 - 01:22:05 - Prayers for others and ourselves
Response:  Loving Lord,  we lift our prayers to you

01:22:08 - Hymn: R&amp;S 285  O for a thousand tongues to sing                       

01:25:54 - 01:26:12 - Closing blessing

01:26:48 - 01:33:46 - Music after the service</media:description>
