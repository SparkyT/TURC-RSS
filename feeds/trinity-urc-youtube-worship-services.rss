07:37 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able),

07:45 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

09:42 - Short time of quiet to prepare for worship

10:03 - Call to worship (from Psalm 90)
Lord of all life you have been our dwelling-place
throughout all generations.
Before the mountains were born
or you brought forth the whole world,
from everlasting to everlasting you are God.

10:54 - 13:28 - Hymn - R&amp;S 260 Christ is alive!

16:20 - 25:31 - All age talk: ‘how much do you love?’
Reflecting on the commandment to love God and neighbor, relating a story of a grandparent's overflowing love for a grandchild. 
Our love for God requires complete commitment, proven by a life overflowing with sharing God's love. 
We are challenged to let God's love heal and overflow into hurting lives, praying for those in need. 
Like Christ, we must let our light shine out into our communities, accepting the invitation and challenge to go out and make God's love known.
Pray for someone specific who needs love today.
An invitation and challenge to go out and shine light.

News of the ‘Let your light shine’ initiative.

27:37 - 32:28 - Worship Songs
MP 1040 Come now is the time to worship
MP 376 Jesus put this song into our hearts

Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and we
share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and also with you) or
there are activities at the back of church.

33:09 - Introduction to the readings
34:39 - 36:34 - Reading Leviticus 19. 1,2, 9 – 18 NIVUK read by Sue Thorne
36:40 - 39:02 - Reading Matthew 22:34-46 (Good News) read by John Hillson

39:46 - 42:18 - Hymn - R&amp;S 745 A new commandment I give to you

42:23 - 59:19 - Address: ‘Love and justice’
Focus on the command to love God and neighbor from Leviticus.
Jesus deepened this command in 4 key ways.
  Jesus linked the command to love your neighbor as yourself with the command to love God with all your heart, soul, and mind. He saw them as two parts of the greatest commandment.
  Expanding &quot;neighbor&quot; to include all people, challenging tribalism. Jesus taught that &quot;neighbor&quot; includes those outside your own community, like the Good Samaritan helping a stranger.
  Demonstrating the depth of love through his life and death. Jesus showed what self-sacrificial, agape love looks like in his ministry, death on the cross, and resurrection.
  Giving the power to love through the Holy Spirit. At Pentecost, Jesus gave the gift of the Holy Spirit to empower his followers to love others as he loved them.
Love is practical - Leviticus gives examples.
Caring for vulnerable, pursuing justice - core themes.
Love and justice needed in conflicts like Israel Palestine.
Exploring Jesus' radical expanding of the command from Leviticus to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Jesus linked loving God fully with loving all neighbors, demonstrated self-sacrificial love, and gave the power of the Spirit to love. Leviticus shows love is practical - caring for vulnerable, pursuing justice. We're called to follow Jesus' example and love all, even enemies, challenging tribalism with God's overflowing love.

01:00:28 - 01:03:58 - Hymn R&amp;S 108 The love of God is broad

01:04:01 - 01:11:06 - Prayers for the church and the world with the response
We thank you for your great love and compassion:
help us to show that love today.

01:11:25 - 01:14:55 - Hymn - R&amp;S 95 God is love

01:14:56 - 01:15:29 - Blessing

38:41 - 01:00:34 - Sermon &quot;It is I; don't be afraid&quot;
followed by a time of quiet reflection
Jesus walks on water to meet the disciples in the storm. This shows his power over nature and the elements.
The story links to the Old Testament accounts of God's deliverance, exceeding Moses. It reveals Jesus' divine identity.
The disciples were obeying Jesus by going across the lake, yet still faced difficulty. Obeying God doesn't prevent troubles.
Jesus reassured the frightened disciples in the storm. He comes alongside us in our difficulties too.
Fear caused the disciples to panic and be influenced by superstition. We must not let fear and imagination misguide us.
Jesus said &quot;It is I, do not be afraid&quot; - echoing God's divine name. His words bring comfort.
To reach safety, the disciples had to invite Jesus into the boat. We need to let Jesus in our lives and trust Him.
Though believers face storms, Jesus offers security. He walked toward the disciples to help them.
The way out of hardship is to let go of fear, respond in faith, and let Jesus lead. He will never let us down.
Jesus gives forgiveness, new life and purpose. He goes with us each day, leading us eternally into God's presence.
This passage reveals Jesus' divine power and identity. Though followers face difficulties, Jesus offers comfort, security and purpose to those who trust Him. We must let go of fear, respond in faith, and let Him lead us through life's storms into the safety of God's presence.
A priest, a vicar and a Baptist minister go fishing together. The priest walks on the water to retrieve something he forgot, then comes back. Later, the vicar does the same. When the Baptist minister tries, he falls into the water. The priest asks the vicar if they should tell the Baptist minister where the stones are that they walked on.

05:54 - 08:29 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

Introduction to the service (All age talk)
09:12 - Collection of Shoeboxes and Update on work of Link to Hope
by Daphne

17:00 - Offering Prayer (for the boxes and all our gifts for the work of
the church)

18:21 - 20:43 - Hymn - Father, I place into your hands

21:55 - 23:53 - Reading: Proverbs 3.1 – 18 read by Lesley

24:11 - 26:40 - Mark 10.17 – 31 NIVUK read by Ian 

26:57 - 29:44 - HYMN 517 As the bride is to her chosen
[Tune: Bridegroom]

29:50 - 43:02 - Address - Wisdom and generosity.
The readings are from Proverbs and Mark's Gospel about wisdom and generosity in daily life.
These themes are universal and apply to all humanity.
Proverbs was written to help Jews returning from exile reapply God's teachings.
Proverbs encourages following the Ten Commandments, trusting God, and turning from evil.
Wisdom is praised as more valuable than material riches.
In Mark's Gospel, Jesus meets a rich young man interested in following him.
Jesus tells the man to sell possessions and give the money to the poor.
The man is grieved because he can't let go of his possessions.
We who are rich must be generous and care for others.
Here is a paragraph for sermon notes:

The universal themes of wisdom and generosity from ancient Jewish texts apply to us today. Though wealthy, we must use wisdom in following God's laws and practice generosity through charity. We should care for others, especially the poor and those with challenges. This sermon calls us to examine our priorities and attachments that may limit generosity. Will we, like the rich young man, cling to possessions? Or will we joyfully share our riches with compassion?

Proverbs contains wise sayings, some dating back before 900 BC to King Solomon's time.
The later reflective passages in Proverbs were written around 520 BC when the Temple was rebuilt in Jerusalem after the Jews returned from exile in Babylon.
These passages were meant to help the returning Jews remember and reapply God's teachings and the Ten Commandments after being away for two generations.
Mark's Gospel was written around 30 years after Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection.
The story takes place around 25 AD as Jesus travels from Caesarea Philippi to Capernaum with his disciples.
Jesus had ministry in the Holy Land, also known as Israel/Palestine, the area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
The Jews had been absent from the Holy Land for about 450 years until the exodus from Egypt led by Moses.
This sermon connects the ancient wisdom from Proverbs to Jesus' teachings, showing continuity in Jewish thought across different historical periods.

10:11 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

10:26 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)
Thinking of events in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine

12:08 - Short time of quiet to prepare for worship

12:50 - Call to worship (Psalm 19. 7 – 9)
The law of the LORD is perfect, refreshing the soul.
The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the
simple.   The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the
heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to
the eyes.   The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring for ever.
The decrees of the LORD are firm, and all of them are righteous.

13:32 - 16:07 - Hymn R&amp;S 405 Angel voices ever singing

16:10 - 18:18 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

19:32 - 22:00 - Reading: Matthew 21. 33 - 46 read by Arthur Winning

22:11 - 27:20 - Reading  Isaiah 5 followed by an introduction to the service

Introduction to the service (All age talk)
Living down the road in a nice little flat with a lovely garden.
What would one do if they won the lottery.
A gardener for their current home.
Admiring a neighbor's well-kept garden.
Gardeners can feel kinship with God depicted as a gardener.
The passage describes God as a gardener cultivating a vineyard.
Imagine God as a divine gardener nurturing a vineyard, desiring good fruits of justice and righteousness. 
What fruits of faith God hopes to find in the church and world today.

27:33 - 30:24 - Hymn R&amp;S 277 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and we
share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and also with you) or
there are activities at the back of church.

31:16 - 33:32 - Reading: Philippians 3. 4b - 14 read by Norma Garden

33:48 - 37:24 - Hymn - R&amp;S 267 Immortal Love for ever full

37:33 - Address
Should Jesus be called meek and mild or provocative and disruptive?
Challenging the childhood prayer depicting Jesus as &quot;meek and mild.&quot;
Jesus shows aggression in the temple, overturning tables and disrupting commerce.
Jesus also shows kindness in healing the blind and lame.
Jesus curses the unfruitful fig tree, showing no mildness.
Jesus provokes and needles the Pharisees with parables.
The parable depicts the Pharisees as corrupt tenants who murder the landowner's son.
The Pharisees show no mercy in saying the tenants will meet a wretched end.
Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone the builders rejected.
Jesus threatens to take the kingdom from those not producing fruit.
The speaker challenges listeners to see their own reflection in the parable.

In this sermon, we upend the notion of a meek and mild Jesus. Looking at Jesus's aggression in the temple, provocation of the Pharisees, and imagery as a destructive stone, we see a disruptive and wild Jesus who challenges hypocrisy and corruption. 
How do we use power and produce fruit in our own lives? 
May this parable disrupt our assumptions and lead us to greater faithfulness.

02:35 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

02:45 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (Duty Elder)

05:30 - Call to worship (from the Iona Community)
The world belongs to God,
the earth and all its creatures.
How good it is, how wonderful,
to live together in unity.
Love and faith come together,
justice and peace join hands.
Open our lips, Great God,
and our mouths shall proclaim your praise.

06:07 - Hymn - R&amp;S 117 O Lord my God

10:20 - 12:26 - Opening Prayers

12:34 - 26:44 - All age Talk: ‘Season of Creation draws to a close’
The Season of Creation ended on October 4th and focused on justice, peace and caring for the planet.
Walking the river Wye and a fundraising walk.
Extreme flooding is increasing globally due to climate change.
The Thames flood barrier is having to be used more frequently to protect London.
Pacific island churches are threatened by rising seas and pleading for help protecting creation.
A church in Tuvalu may need to evacuate due to the threat of disappearing under rising seas.
There was good and bad news during the Season of Creation, including tree vandalism but also statements from church leaders.
The Prime Minister's remarks about delaying net zero targets caused concern.

Baptist and Methodist leaders issued a joint statement calling for urgent climate action and justice.
The message was to hold politicians accountable and let justice and peace flow like a river.
In summary, the church talk reflected on the Season of Creation and the urgent need for climate justice, highlighting flooding threats, calls from Pacific churches for action, dissent over the UK Prime Minister's climate policies, and a joint Christian leader statement demanding rapid, fair transitions to net zero emissions. We need to hold politicians accountable to bring justice and peace in caring for the threatened planet.


22:34 - A Video: ‘Prince Ea’s Challenge to humanity’ and a Prayer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-nEYsyRlYo

28:29 - Song - MP 1259 Bless the Lord, o my soul

33:12 - 34:46 - Reading: Psalm 25. 1 – 9 NIVUK read by Jeany Bien
34:57 - 37:45 - Matthew 21.23 – 32 NIVUK read by Harri Nola

38:20 - Hymn R&amp;S 493 Dear Master in whose life I see

40:04 - 55:04 - Short Address
Jesus asked many probing questions in the gospels - over 300! Questions can challenge us spiritually.
The religious leaders questioned Jesus' authority aggressively to undermine him.
Jesus cleverly evaded their trap by asking about John the Baptist's authority.
We must decide if Jesus had divine or merely human authority.
Accepting Jesus' authority shapes our lives around his power and vision.
Jesus' authority is central to the church's existence and mission.
With Jesus as Lord, we are called to act, not just express good intentions.
The parable challenges us - are we doing Jesus' work, even if we said yes to him?
People outside the church may live more Christlike lives through action.
We must turn faith into loving action in the world.
Our faith only has meaning if it flowers into purposeful action for justice and care in Jesus' name.

52:30 - 55:04 - A Prayer for the world and the church

55:30 - Welcome of David Bishop into church membership by reaffirmation:

59:34 - 01:03:22 - Hymn R&amp;S 107 The love of God comes close

01:03:22 - Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at
church (or at home) united in the name of Christ.

A Prayer of thanksgiving

01:06:14 - Distribution of bread and wine (non-alcoholic grape juice)

01:13:22 - 01:14:09 - Closing Prayer

06:58 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able),

07:10 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

Short time of quiet to prepare for worship

10:20 - Call to worship
Jesus said, ‘Whoever drinks the water I give them will never
thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a
spring of water welling up to eternal life.’ John 4:14

10:50 - 13:36 - HYMN R&amp;S 689 As pants the hart

13:58 - 17:15 - Opening Prayer and the Lord’s Prayer

17:42 - 24:07 - Story: ‘Tiddalik the Greedy Frog’
The story of Tidlic the frog teaches us about greed and unfair distribution of resources.
On Rivers Sunday, we think about how water is not distributed fairly around the world.
Some of us waste water without thinking, while others lack access to clean water.
We have a responsibility to care for others, not just ourselves.
The story shows how Tidlic was greedy and hoarded all the water.
The animals tried to persuade Tidlic to share but he refused.
Laughter, not threats or anger, finally made Tidlic give back the water.
We should think about how best to persuade others - laughter over scare tactics.
The story is a metaphor - some hoard resources while others lack.
Our faith calls us to share earth's resources more fairly and sustainably.

24:13 - 27:09 - Hymn - MP 554 Peace is flowing like a river

27:56 - 31:22 - Bible Readings:
27:56 - 30:05 - Psalm 104. 5 – 13 NIVUK read by Abigail Lokko
30:25 - 31:22 - Revelation 22. 1 – 5 NIVUK read by Kitty Bird

32:21 - 35:38 - Hymn R&amp;S 340 I have no bucket, and the well is deep

35:47 - 48:30 - Sermon and time of quiet
Rivers run through the whole Bible and represent life, healing, justice and God's blessing.
We love rivers and need them, but have neglected and damaged them through greed and thoughtlessness.
The unfair distribution of water hurts the poor and vulnerable most severely.
Rich nations like ours have contributed most to climate change and river damage, while poorer nations suffer more.
We must care for rivers and share water resources more justly, as God desires.
Our baptism motivates us to care for creation and protect rivers.
We must experience God's living water spiritually, and let it flow out in justice.
This church's eco activities are a great witness - continue and do more.
We must tell politicians that climate change matters to us - take action.
Nourished by God's grace and healing water, we can help justice flow like a river.

49:00 - 50:57 - Hymn R&amp;S 424 At the dawning of creation

50:59 - 54:52 - Prayer for others and for ourselves

55:04 - 57:59 - Hymn R&amp;S 345 Guide me, O thou great Jehovah

58:00 - 58:22 - Blessing

35:44 - 37:29 - Hymn - All across the world (Tune R&amp;S 495)

1. All across the world there’s harvests 
gath’ring food we’re glad to eat; 
though we’ll never meet the farmers, 
keep us thankful for their feat. 

2. Foodstuffs gathered, packed and processed,
shipped and trucked and sold and bought; 
for all people who supply us, 
may we show the thanks we ought. 

3. Where rewards divide unjustly,
workers struggle to survive,
may we act to make trade fairer,
play our part, keep hope alive. 

4. God who cares for all who harvest,
God who cares for all who eat, 
keep us thankful, keep us acting 
’til your justice is complete. 

© 2016 Kevin Mayhew John Campbell 

38:03 - 39:48 - Reading: 2 Corinthians 9:6-15  NIVUK  - read by Valerie and David 

39:54 - 47:51 - Short Talk; 'sow generously'
Gratitude: An expression of thanks to God for His indescribable gift.
Generosity: The importance of generosity, highlighting that all good things come from the generous love and grace of God.
The metaphor of a seed, emphasizing how a seed must be sown, die in the ground, and then produce an incredible harvest.
Jesus' fascination with seeds and how He used parables like the sower and the seed to convey important lessons.
Seeds are described as fascinating because they contain life within a tiny shell and, under the right conditions, can produce something marvelous.
Paul's challenge to a vibrant but sometimes divided Corinthian church.
Giving Cheerfully: Paul encourages cheerful giving and emphasizes that it should be a personal decision rather than driven by guilt or comparison with others.
Multiplication of Seeds: How a single seed of Jesus' life has multiplied into millions or billions of changed lives over centuries.
An example of a simple act of generosity, starting with a small cupboard in Saint Andrews Church, which has grown to help hundreds of thousands of people in need.
The Abundance of God's Love: The immense, indescribable gift of God's love and grace, freely given, and encourages generosity in response.
All good things come from God's abundant love and grace
Generosity is a reflection of God's love and a means to bring blessings to others, creating a harvest of joy and love.

24:50 - 27:22 - Hymn - MP 1343 - O God you search me (Psalm 139)

28:03 - 41:52 - Sermon
Jacob was a lonely, guilty figure fleeing his past when he had the dream.
God had to speak to Jacob in a dream when he was passive to get through to him.
In the dream, Jacob saw a ladder between heaven and earth with angels going up and down.
The passage points to Jesus as the ladder between heaven and earth.
Jesus referred to himself as the ladder between heaven and earth.
The passage also tells us something about the church as a &quot;trusting&quot; place where heaven and earth meet.
The church is a special meeting place between God and people.
The passage addresses us individually in our own lonely, guilty, or dark places.
Even when we don't know it, God can be present with us in those painful places.
Those painful places can later become &quot;Bethel&quot; - the house of God.

16:07 - 18:39 - Opening Four Directional Prayer

18:45 - 29:53 - All age Talk: ‘Season of Creation – rivers of justice and peace’
The river of Life from Revelation, bringing healing.
Rivers start small but grow large, which fascinates the speaker.
The local River Wye is a precious chalk stream needing protection.
The Wye has been polluted and neglected over the years.
Local groups like Revive the Wye aim to restore and protect the river.
Rivers worldwide are being damaged through pollution.
Rivers are sacred places in scripture that we must protect.

30:25 - A Prayer of new beginning
(by Revd James Shri Bhagwan, General Secretary of the Pacific Conference of Churches)
God of hope and healing may your Rivers of Righteousness
wash away our apathy, our greed and selfishness and reveal
the deep relationships You created for us with all creation.
Nourish us with the water of life that restores, turning
deserts of despair into oases of hope.
May the waves of Your embrace transform us back into
guardians of Your creation.
May the currents of Your justice carry us to Your lagoon of
peace where all creation may enjoy Life in abundance
We pray in the name of the one who came, so that the whole
cosmos may have everlasting life, Jesus the Christ. Amen.

49:52 - 50:54 - Amos 5: 21-24 (NIVUK) read by Elsje Hatton
51:03 - 52:00 - John 7:37-39 (NIVUK) read by Tony Hatton

52:35 - 57:57 - Short Address
Rivers are powerful parts of creation and nature.
Local rivers like the Wye provided power for industry and development.
But rivers have been neglected, polluted, and abused over the years.
Rivers are sacred places in scripture and tradition.
Rivers symbolize life and renewal.
Rivers need protection and care as precious resources.
Rivers can symbolize justice and righteousness flowing through society.
And rivers can symbolize the Spirit flowing in our hearts to cleanse and renew.
We're called to care for physical rivers, work for societal justice, and seek inner spiritual renewal.

Rivers have physical power in creation and enabled industrial development locally. But sadly, rivers have been neglected and polluted over time. Biblically, rivers are sacred places representing life. But our treatment of rivers like the Thames shows need for protection of these precious resources. Second, rivers can symbolize justice and righteousness flowing through society to bring renewal. Third, rivers remind us of the Spirit flowing within, cleansing our hearts. In conclusion, we're called to care for physical rivers, work for justice in society, and seek spiritual renewal from God's Spirit within. Rivers connect us to God's creation, God's justice, and God's Spirit.

58:57 - 01:02:42 - Prayers of concern
Lord of all life teach us; and show us your way.
Lord’s Prayer (version by Jim Cotter)
Eternal Spirit, Earth-maker, Pain-bearer, Life-giver,
Source of all that is and that shall be,
Father and Mother of us all, Loving God, in whom is heaven:
The hallowing of your name echoes through the universe! The
way of your justice be followed by the peoples of the world!
Your heavenly will be done by all created beings! Your
communion of peace and freedom sustain our hope and come
on Earth. With the bread we need for today, feed us. In the
hurts we absorb from one another, forgive us. In times of
temptation and test, strengthen us. From trials too great to
endure, spare us. From the grip of all that is evil, free us. For
you reign in the glory of the power that is love, now and
forever. Amen.

17:44 - 21:36 - Talk for all ages introducing the theme
A new job at G Smith The Undertakers in Wooburn Green.
The speaker was puzzled by the fact that the cost of a funeral plan did not always match the cost of the funeral itself.
This is because the plan is taken out at one point in time, but the funeral may take place at a later date, when prices may have changed.
Compares this to the Gospel story, where Jesus's disciples were trying to figure out who he was.
Jesus knew that they had different ideas about him, but he wanted them to make the discovery for themselves.
We should also try to make our own discoveries about God.
When we discover something for ourselves, we are more likely to remember it and understand it better.
The speaker gives the example of learning that fire is hot or that cement hardens.
The speaker says that Jesus sensed that his disciples were almost ready to discover that he was the Messiah.
The speaker says that Simon Peter was the first disciple to make this discovery.
Jesus's disciples were trying to figure out who he was. Jesus knew that they had different ideas about him, but he wanted them to make the discovery for themselves. We should also try to make our own discoveries about God. When we discover something for ourselves, we are more likely to remember it and understand it better.

27:15 - Hymn - Just as I am

31:24 - 41:32 - Address, followed by a time of quiet reflection 
Reflecting on the previous sermon series on Revelation.
Why the lectionary is used for most services rather than exploring other parts of the Bible.
Doing the daily office with readings and psalms from the lectionary.
Fewer churches have evening services now, and we are poorer for it
Certain Bible passages and hymns conjure up thoughts about God.
Recalling a confirmation class discussion about hymns portraying God.
One student said a hymn portrayed God like an almighty corset.
Today's Romans passage reminds us of a previous sermon on not thinking too highly of yourself.
Relating this to the unattractive character of Uriah Heep from David Copperfield.
Does emphasizing humility makes some people think even less of themselves.
Does stressing humility leads some people to think even less of themselves when they already face challenges to their self-esteem from lack of education, employment, or respect from others.

08:10 - Call to worship (from Psalm 100)
Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth;
Let us worship the Lord with gladness.
Come into God’s presence with singing,
For we know the Lord is God.
God made us and we belong to God.

09:15 - HYMN R&amp;S 660 Hark what a sound

12:26 - 14:18 - Opening Prayer

14:19 - 21:33 - Introduction to reading – ‘all made new’
We're nearing the end of our series on Revelation 
Revelation is an amazing, strange, difficult book
It was debated if Revelation should be included in the Bible
But it was included and challenges, puzzles, and inspires us 
Our series has led us to the final chapters 21-22
These give a vision of new things, a new beginning 
A new heaven, new earth, and New Jerusalem 
It's not that heaven and earth don't exist anymore, but they are renewed 
Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth
Try something new

We are nearing the end of their sermon series on Revelation, which she describes as an amazing but difficult book that was debated for inclusion in the Bible but ultimately included. The series has led them to the final chapters 21-22, which give a vision of new things and a new beginning, including a new heaven, new earth, and New Jerusalem. This doesn't mean heaven and earth don't exist anymore, but they are renewed.

21:34 - 24:27 - A new heaven and new earth - Reading: Revelation 21. 1 – 7 (Good News)
read by John Hillson

24:57 - 27:06 - SONG R&amp;S 271 You are the king of glory

27:10 - 32:07 - A new Jerusalem - Reading: Revelation 21. 10 – 11, 21 – 26 read by John Hillson

32:17 - 38:11 - Talk: Light of our lives
The new Jerusalem needs no sun or moon to shine on it
The glory of God shines on it and the Lamb is its lamp 
Ancient people worshiped the sun for its life-giving light and warmth
The moon was seen as a lesser god, creating seasons and rhythms 
Cities produced their own light with oil lamps in John's day
But today's light pollution would astonish ancients
John knows the importance of light
But the true light is God's spiritual light - the glory of God
This has been seen in Jesus, the Lamb on the cross 
If we learn one thing from John, it is to worship the living God 
The theme of light, referring to the passage just read about how the New Jerusalem needs no sun or moon because God is its light. Ancient people worshiped the sun and moon but that John sees the true light as the spiritual light of God's glory, revealed in Jesus Christ. The main message from John is to worship the living God, not lesser things.

38:27 - 42:31 - SONG TP 62 Shine Jesus, shine

43:16 - 45:14 - A new hope for all the nations -Reading Revelation 22. 1 – 9 (Good News) read by Sue Thorne

45:23 - 51:23 - Talk: John’s Do’s and don'ts
John tries to take in all he's seen and heard in the vision 
He is overwhelmed and kneels to worship the angel
But the angel says &quot;Don't do it&quot; 
Don't worship me, worship God
Don't worship lesser things, only God 
Not the Bible, ministers, rulers, wealth, technology or military might 
The emperor demanded worship as God's son
But the angels say these words can be trusted - worship God
Jesus says happy are those who obey the prophetic words 
The message is simple - worship the living God

John is overwhelmed by the vision and kneels to worship the angel, but is told not to worship lesser things, only God. Rulers like the emperor demanded worship but angels tell John the words are true - worship God. The message is not to worship human rulers and powers but only the living God. This is the simple message to obey from Revelation.

11:43 - Call to worship (from Psalm 46)
God is our refuge and strength,
Always ready to help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change,
though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea;
God is in our midst of the city, we shall not be moved;
God will help us when the morning dawns.
The nations are in an uproar, the kingdoms totter;
God utters his voice, the earth melts.
The LORD of hosts is with us;
the God of Jacob is our refuge.

12:43 - 16:04 - Hymn -  Meekness and majesty

16:09 - 17:49 - Opening Prayers

17:54 - Introduction to the reading

18:58 - Reading: Revelation 7.9 – 12 (minister and congregation)
 
20:06 - 30:48 - All age Talk: ‘After Alpha’ 
The book of Revelation has many oddities and strangeness but its main theme is worshiping God.
It calls us to put aside other things that demand worship and focus on glorifying God.
Revelation gives glimpses of heavenly worship with people and angels praising God.
We began looking at Revelation and its vision of God as Alpha and Omega - the beginning and end.
Our purpose is to glorify God who encompasses all eternity.
After Alpha comes Beta - we are covering chapters 6-19 today.
These chapters describe the spiritual battle between good and evil.
But there are also beautiful encouraging words like blessings and the bridegroom.
We must hold onto all that is good, truthful and beautiful.
Remember verses calling us to worship and honor God, the one who created heaven and earth.
The Book of Revelation, despite its strangeness, calls us to worship God above all else. We get glimpses of heavenly praise, and are reminded that God is the beginning and end - our purpose is to glorify Him. Though the middle chapters describe spiritual struggle, they also have beautiful words about God's blessings and love. We must hold onto the good and continue worshiping the Creator.

31:11 - 33:00 - Song -  All heaven declares

45:20 - 48:24 - Hymn -  Blessed assurance

48:34 - 01:00:16 - Short Address
Revelation repeatedly calls us to simple heartfelt worship of God.
It invites us to put aside earthly idols that demand our worship.
John wrote Revelation when Christians faced persecution from the Roman empire.
The churches he wrote to were frightened by the empire's military might.
But John reminds them that Rome is not the ultimate power - God is.
There is a spiritual battle between good and evil described in these chapters.
Though it talks of destructive forces, God can destroy destruction without being destructive.
Heaven falls silent so God can hear the cries of his people on earth.
At the communion table, we proclaim the lamb sacrificed on the cross as the ultimate power, not political or military forces.
We must continue to worship God amidst life's struggles, holding onto all that is good.
We explore Revelation's call to worship God above all earthly powers. Though the middle chapters describe spiritual battles, John reminds us that God, not the mighty Roman empire, is the ultimate power. God destroys evil without being destructive himself. Overall we are to worship God amidst life's struggles, proclaiming Christ's sacrifice as the greatest power.

59:19 - Reading: Revelation 19.6 – 9a read by Ian 

01:00:59 - 01:04:14 - Hymn - Jesus calls us here to meet him

11:54 - 16:04 - Talk for all ages: ‘The king and the kingdom’
Jesus often taught people using parables - stories that related to everyday life
Parables helped people understand Jesus' message through familiar examples
Many parables were about farming, baking bread, family relationships
If Jesus was here today, parables might use modern examples like technology, business, shopping
The word &quot;parable&quot; means to place beside as a comparison or illustration
There are about 40 parables total in the Bible, with the most in Matthew and Luke
Matthew 13 has 7 parables in a row, mostly about the Kingdom of Heaven
The Kingdom of Heaven refers not just to heaven, but God's kingdom on earth too
Jesus came as our King to show God's love and wants us to be part of God's kingdom
Reflecting on parables helps us understand more about God's love and kingdom

16:24 - Hymn – The kingdom of God is justice and Joy

19:04 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities (if the children

The parable of the mustard seed shows the kingdom started small but grew greatly.
The parable of the yeast shows how the kingdom expands and multiplies.
The treasure and pearl show the great value of the kingdom.
The net parable refers to final judgment and separation of good/wicked.
Solomon exemplifies using discernment to govern justly as part of God's kingdom.
God blessed Solomon with wisdom when he sought to discern God's will as king.
We are not fully living in God's kingdom now with all the world's problems.
But we can see signs of God's kingdom through people helping others.
Our role is to help grow God's kingdom by discerning and doing God's will.
Reflecting on parables helps us understand our part in advancing God's kingdom.
Examining the parables reminds us to discern God's will so we can help grow His righteous kingdom.

20:42 - 29:58 - Talk for all ages – The kingdom of God
The kingdom of God is not a place, club or building.
It is a personal encounter with God through prayer, listening and obedience.
We experience the kingdom when we are in communion with God.
When we listen and obey God, we experience more of the kingdom.
The kingdom is defined by God's perfect love.
The kingdom seems beyond limits of time.
We can feel far from God and the kingdom when life is hard.
But God's love remains through good and bad times.
The Lord's Prayer says the kingdom comes when God's will is done on earth.
As we follow God's will, we experience more of the kingdom.

The kingdom of God is not a physical place, but rather a personal encounter with God through prayer, diligent listening and obedience. We experience the kingdom when we are in full communion with the Lord, truly listening and following His will. The more we listen and obey, the more we live in the kingdom. God's perfect love defines the kingdom, which seems beyond earthly limits of time. Though we can feel far from God when life gets hard, His love remains constant. The kingdom comes when God's will is done on earth, as the Lord's Prayer says. As we seek and follow the will of God in our lives, we come to know the kingdom in a real and personal way.

00:40:28 - 00:53:39 - Address: The Kingdom of God. followed by a time of quiet reflection
Why do people come to church?  The promise of eternal life is not a motivating factor.
The kingdom of God is exciting but hard to grasp
Jesus told parables to describe the kingdom
The kingdom starts small but grows large
It changes us with just a small presence
The kingdom is of greatest value
We must seek the kingdom like hidden treasure
It is for everyone, no one is excluded
God's perfect love defines the kingdom
The kingdom is beyond limits of time
We live the kingdom by following God's will
Jesus used parables to convey the kingdom of God, which begins humbly but grows to greatness. Though elusive, we must seek the kingdom like a treasure.  It holds supreme value and is defined by God's perfect love, extending to all people without limits of time. We live the kingdom by seeking and following God's will in our lives.
