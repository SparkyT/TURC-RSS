   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00:00 - Music before the service

07:39 - Entry of the bible and lighting of the peace candle

07:57 - Welcome and explanation of worship today

10:38 - Share at your table - something you are grateful for, from
the week past

Gathering and opening prayer
Glorify the LORD with me;
let us exalt God’s name together.
It is good to give thanks to the Lord
For God’s love endures for ever

16:59 - Praise Songs led by worship band
MP 1259 Bless the Lord of my soul
MP 465 Meekness and majesty
MP 1003 My Jesus, my Saviour

28:10 - Prayer and Lord’s Prayer

29:21 - Introducing the reading

30:20 - 31:00 - Reading John 12:20-22 NIVUK read by Nathanael Bello
20  Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to
worship at the festival.  21  They came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. ‘Sir,’ they said, ‘we would like to
see Jesus.’  22  Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn
told Jesus.

31:11 - 37:47 - Talk: ‘Wanting to see’

Question 1: How do we help people to ‘see’ Jesus?
38:11 - Prayers with Song TP 74 Open our eyes we want to see Jesus (x 2)

40:04 - Seeing Jesus in each other – coffee served at the tables

53:02 - 54:50 - Reading John 12:22-33 read by Harri Bello
23  Jesus replied, ‘The hour has come for the Son of Man to be
glorified.  24  Very truly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the
ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it
produces many seeds.  25  Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while
anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal
life.  26  Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my
servant also will be. My Father will honour the one who serves me.
27  ‘Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? “Father,
save me from this hour”? No, it was for this very reason I came to
this hour.  28  Father, glorify your name!’
Then a voice came from heaven, ‘I have glorified it, and will
glorify it again.’  29  The crowd that was there and heard it said it had
thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
30  Jesus said, ‘This voice was for your benefit, not mine.  31  Now is the
time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be
driven out.  32  And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all
people to myself.’  33  He said this to show the kind of death he was
going to die.

55:57 - Question 2: What does this reading tell us about the death
of Jesus?

56:07 - 01:00:52 - Talk: ‘the One and the many’

01:01:22 - 01:02:53 - Reading: ‘One Solitary Life’

01:03:23 - 01:05:03 - Song TP 102 You laid aside your majesty

01:05:10 - Question 3: how might we glorify God’s name today?

01:05:26 - 01:10:40 - Prayers for ourselves and the world with response
Song R&amp;S 375 In my life Lord be glorified

01:10:47 - Activity at tables – sow a seed
Spend a few moments quietly thinking about how the seed
must ‘die’ (split open and shrivel up) in order for new
growth to come. 

Then we offer this prayer:
01:21:50 - Lord, you have sown the seed of your love in our hearts.
May we welcome and nurture your love.
Calm our fears and make our prejudices fade away and
die.
May we welcome and nurture your love.
Help us to open our hearts and our arms to others.
May we welcome and nurture your love.
Loving Lord, keep us in your love.
May we welcome and nurture your love,
now and for ever. Amen.

01:22:33 - 01:26:33 - Hymn R&amp;S 289 To God be the glory

01:26:34 - 01:26:49 - The grace

01:27:08 - 01:30:14 - Music after the service

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00:00 - Music before the service

07:04 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

07:21 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

08:49 - Call to worship - Psalm 63: vs 1-5 - we say together

10:04 - Hymn MP 712 Turn your eyes upon Jesus (chorus only x2)

11:54 - Hymn MP 454 Majesty, worship his majesty 

14:34 - Hymn MP 1076 Jesus be the centre

16:57 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

19:54 - 24:22 - All age talk: “Mother’s day”
We've all got mothers, even if we don't have them anymore. 
Empathy is understanding what someone is going through. As mothers, you also multitask, are flexible when plans change, nurse injured children, and more.
We try to remind those mothers that they have gifts they don't realize - organization, timekeeping, cooking, cleaning - a mother is special.
Maybe some of you didn't have such an easy mother. Some feel neglected. But a mother's job is so difficult.
We thank God for the gifts to be good parents and grandparents, for the teachings to guide and empower us.
Today, let's pray for struggling mothers - financial issues, difficult relationships or single parents.


24:25 - Blessing as Junior Church go to their activities:
Adults: May the Lord be with you
Junior Church: And also with you
All: Amen

25:01 - 27:11 - Old Testament Reading: Psalm 145 

28:50 - 23:27 - Hymn. MP 1350 Speak o Lord

33:10 - 34:42 - New Testament Reading: 2 Peter 1: 1 – 11

34:50 - 58:42 - Sermon “God’s Divine Power and His Precious Promises&quot; 
Do you to know God's abundant grace and peace through truly knowing Him, not just biblical knowledge. Do you regularly talk to Him and give Him your problems?
God says He has given you everything you need for life and godliness through His divine power. Do you believe that, even for areas you struggle with?
When you became a Christian, God's Holy Spirit came to live in you, giving you access to all God's power and resources. Do you realize what that means?
Don't just try to change in your own strength. Give your problems fully to God, and let His Spirit empower you. I had to do that for worrying.
For even small decisions, ask God which way He wants you to go. He may have purposes you don't realize by choosing one way over another.
God has given us very great and precious promises to participate in His divine nature. Read and claim His promises for your life.
Make every effort to add virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, kindness and love to the faith God gave you.
If you lack these, you become ineffective and unproductive, forgetting you've been cleansed from sin. Don't let that happen!
Therefore, confirm your calling. If you cultivate these qualities, you'll never stumble and receive a rich welcome into Christ's eternal Kingdom.

A time of quiet reflection

58:59 - 01:03:01- Hymn. R&amp;S 92 Amazing Grace”

01:03:21 - 01:07:07 - Prayers for others and ourselves

00:00:00 - Music before the service

04:29 - Entry of Bible (please stand if you are able)

04:59 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

06:25 - Call to worship: taken from Mark 8:34

07:15 - Hymn: R&amp;S 107 The love of God comes close, tune: Rhosymedre

11:31 - Opening prayers of Approach, Confession &amp;amp; Thanksgiving

16:55 - The Lord’s Prayer (modern version)

WE LISTEN FOR GOD’S WORD
17:38 - 20:49 - Reading: Mark 8:31-38 read by John Hillson

20:54 - 26:22 - All Age Talk: Seek the cross and gain life?
Live Origami in church (#firsttime, #newtrick)
It's a risky trick with no safety net
The trick will help understand the Gospel reading about finding fullness of life
Folding the paper to represent different aspects of life - mountain, house, airplane 
The airplane represents jetting off and enjoying life
The tricky part is cutting the paper in half down the middle
Unfolding the paper reveals a cross shape - picking up your cross
Arranging the cross pieces spells out &quot;life&quot;
Following the way of the cross leads to fullness of life
The minister's friend Paul Robinson suggested the trick


26:52 - Hymn: R&amp;S 522 From heaven you came (The Servant King)

31:07 - Junior Church continue activities in the Meeting Place (and
we share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and also with
you: Amen,) or there are activities at the back of church.

31:30 - 34:29 - Reading: Mark 14:53-54, 66-72 read by Jeany Bien

34:54 - 37:32 - Hymn: R&amp;S 355 Jesus calls us! O’er the tumult, tune: Cross of
Jesus

37:37 - 48:03 - Sermon: Take up your cross
The gospel reading is emotional, vivid, and terrifying for the disciples
We should try to put ourselves in the disciples' shoes and feel their fear
This was the first time Jesus told them he would die and rise again
The disciples likely shut down and didn't comprehend or believe Jesus
Peter denies Jesus will die, and Jesus rebukes him harshly
Jesus challenges the Jewish authorities' corruption and collusion with Rome 
Jesus asks the disciples to &quot;pick up their cross&quot; - shocking language about a painful death 
Jesus does not promise an easy life - it will involve suffering
We may not be called to Jesus' level of suffering, but our cross will still be difficult
Like Peter, we may fail to embrace the cross, but will have repeated chances to try again 

WE MAKE OUR RESPONSE

48:30 - 51:29 - Hymn: Trinity Praise 13 – Be Still, for the presence of the
Lord

51:33 - Dedication of the Offertory

52:13 - 57:07 - Prayers of Intercession

57:37 - 01:02:25 - Hymn: R&amp;S 530 Living God, your joyful Spirit, tune: Abbots Leigh

01:02:27 - 01:02:50 - Closing blessing

01:03:12 - 01:05:57 - Music after the service

Hymn: R&amp;S 123 Think of a world

39:04 - 57:10 -  Address: followed by time of quiet reflection
The story discusses an abandoned lighthouse that was converted by a local artist into a climbing center for youth, shining a symbolic light when they reach the top, as well as a Methodist church that wants to serve its struggling community by offering its building to help distribute secondhand children's clothing and &quot;shine a light&quot; by helping people live better lives even if they don't attend church.
The lighthouse was abandoned and there were unsuccessful plans to convert it into a museum, restaurant, or flats.
Tam McCarthy had a vision to convert it into a climbing center to help the local youth.
Tam was a local artist who became successful and gave back to the community.
The climbing center at the lighthouse became very popular and successful.
The light at the top of the lighthouse is lit when someone reaches the top, symbolizing their achievement.
Many local Methodist churches have closed down and they want to keep their church open.
They want to use their building to serve the community even if people don't attend church.
An example is allowing a group to distribute secondhand children's clothing from the church.
Church activities don't have to directly involve the church, the goal is to help the community.
They hope to metaphorically &quot;shine a light&quot; and help people live better lives even if they don't attend church.

   <media:description>Morning worship from Trinity United Reformed Church, High Wycombe 

00:00:00 - Music before the service

07:19 - Entry of the bible

07:39 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

10:47 - Call to worship: verses from Psalm 50 
The mighty one, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
Our God comes and does not keep silent; 
before him  is a devouring fire and a mighty tempest all around him.
He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he  may judge his people:
“Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!”
The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. 

13:12 - Hymn: R&amp;S 373 Lord Jesus Christ, we have come to you

16:25 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

19:30 - 28:49 - Introduction to the theme
God's mystery and wonder, focusing on mountaintop experiences like Jesus' transfiguration.
Has anyone had any special experiences recently
Flowers from the garden like snowdrops that lift the heart after winter.
In the transfiguration story, Jesus took his closest disciples Peter, James and John up a mountain.
Jesus was transfigured, his clothes shining white, with Moses and Elijah appearing.
The disciples were terrified by this divine vision showing Jesus' glory.
God's voice affirms Jesus as his Son, saying to listen to him.
Like baptism and Jesus' birth, this is a rare moment where heaven meets earth.
The transfiguration comes as Jesus heads toward his death, affirming God's plan.
We should listen for God's wonder and mystery as we gather in faith.
Glimpses of God's divine wonder and mystery in mountaintop spiritual experiences like Jesus' transfiguration, where he was affirmed by Moses, Elijah and God's voice as the beloved Son, and similarly at his baptism and birth.

Readings:  
29:40 - 32:31 - 2 Kings 2:1-12 read by Sue
32:46 - 34:21 - Mark 9:2-9 read by Abigail

34:51 - 37:14 - Hymn:  R&amp;S 572 Colours of day dawn into the mind

37:49 - 01:00:23 - Address:  Christ revealed  - followed by time of quiet reflection 
The readings involve mystery and symbolism, raising questions rather than giving clear answers.
The story of Elijah and Elisha - Elisha asks to take on Elijah's spirit before Elijah is taken up to heaven.
The story foreshadows Elisha becoming the next prophet and inheriting a &quot;double portion&quot; of Elijah's spirit.
There are visions, miracles and God's power in the stories.
The Transfiguration shows Jesus' divine nature as well as his humanity.
We are all created in God's image and should reflect God's glory in our actions.
We can glimpse God's glory in ordinary things like nature, a baby being born, a friend's wisdom.
Lent is a time for pause, reflection and prayer as we approach Easter.
A smile each day in Lent can spread joy and reflect God's light in us.
We need feeding from God's light like solar panels need sunlight.

01:00:49 - 01:03:30 - Hymn: R&amp;S 67   Immortal, Invisible, God only wise (tune: Haresfield)

01:03:32 - 01:10:13 - Prayers of Intersession
 Response:   Lord in your mercy  Hear our prayer

01:10:23 - 01:13:34 - Hymn:  Christ triumphant

Favorite hymns and films that lift their spirits when down.
What makes us feel better needs to be the right remedy for the situation.
One of the best ways to help people feel better is to care for them and show love.
Caring for yourself when a carer
TV and radio provide comfort but don't replace real company.
Jesus was very concerned for the weak and ill.
People were always looking for Jesus, but he would withdraw to pray and recharge.
These words can help discover the healing that comes through faith in God.
Things that can make people feel better when they are down, from music to care and company, noting that the remedy should fit the need.

Working at the airport learning other ways to share faith.
Actions can preach, but words are still needed to share the hope within us.

24:43 Hymn - R&amp;S 332 Jesus lover of my soul

29:10 - 38:38 - Address
Reflecting on school days and strict teachers like the headmaster who also served in church.
The Bible passage about Jesus' teaching makes us think about impactful teachers.
Jesus taught with authority unlike the rabbis who referenced earlier teachings.
Jesus was confident in his identity as God's Son which integrated his character and teaching.
We should also be ready to give account of our hope without just appealing to the past.
Jesus' words had immediate impact, like healing the man. His message was freedom.
Jesus walked the walk, not just talked. We should have integrating words and actions.
Jesus earned authority by freeing and helping people, not from any office.
We need to know our beloved identity in Christ through baptism and worship.
Our everyday words and actions should bring God's kingdom like Jesus did.
We are reminded to internalize our Christian identity so that our actions align with our words in bringing positive change, rather than relying solely on past teaching.

07:53 - Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

09:37 - Call to worship

10:27 - 12:22 - Hymn - R&amp;S 565 Jesus stand among us

12:25 - Prayer of adoration
14:17 - Lord’s Prayer

15:00 - 28:18 - Introduction for all ages: ‘You’re welcome.’
Material for the week prepared by Christians in Burkina Faso focused on the Good Samaritan parable and loving your neighbor. 
Burkina Faso is experiencing major unrest and terrorism, with over 2 million displaced people.
Links to a couple previously held hostage there that we prayed for. 
The importance of welcoming others, like Abraham and Sarah showing hospitality to angel visitors. Ways to welcome include providing refreshments and making people comfortable.


28:48 - 30:05 - Reading: Genesis 18:1-8 Good News

WORSHIP SONGS
31:22 - MP 1221 Praise is rising
34:39 - MP 1046 Give thanks to the Lord our God and King

48:33 - 01:00:32 - Address - The Transforming Power of Love for Neighbour
The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us the meaning of loving our neighbor
The Good Samaritan went far beyond what was expected to care for the wounded stranger
We should not just pass by those in need but stop and truly help
Unity and reconciliation are needed in divided communities like Burkina Faso
Christians there are working together across denominations to help displaced people
We must have hope - &quot;the moment of reconciliation will come&quot;
The command to love God and neighbor matters more than religious laws and debates
We must move from seeing &quot;neighbor&quot; as a noun to becoming a neighbor through action
We can collaborate to be Good Samaritans addressing desperation in our own communities
Love never ends - it bears, believes, hopes and endures all things
Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan, focusing on the Samaritan's loving action towards the wounded stranger. This radical care for neighbor should inspire Christians today, even in divided communities, to work together in reconciliation and service. 

01:00:33 - Affirmation of Love (verses from 1 Corinthians 13)

Lord Jesus, who prayed that all might be one,
we pray to you for the unity of all Christians,
according to your will, according to your means.
May your Spirit enable us to experience
the suffering caused by division,
to see our sin and to hope beyond all hope. Amen.

Welcome and Lighting of peace candle (by Duty Elder)

Call to worship

HYMN R&amp;amp;S 187 Worship the Lord

Prayer of approach

Introduction for all ages: ‘Well, that’s agreed.’

Prayer ‘Agreement to forgive’
Lord, teach us to pray in spirit and in truth
to love as you love us, to forgive as you forgive us,
To seek your will and work for your kingdom
Of peace and justice, kindness and compassion.
Lord, teach us to truly pray: Lord’s Prayer

HYMN R&amp;amp;S 603 Lord for the years

(and we share a blessing – the Lord be with you; and
also with you) or there are activities at back of church.
Introduction to the readings

Reading: Jeremiah 31.31 – 34 NIVUK read by Elsje Hatton

Prayer: ‘Seeking God’s forgiveness’ from Psalm 51
God, in your constant love, have mercy on me,     
In your great compassion blot out my transgressions.
Wash away all my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.
Create in me a pure heart, O God,
and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me from your presence
or take your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of your salvation
and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
You are God my Saviour,
and I will sing of your righteousness.
Open my lips, Lord,
and my mouth will declare your praise.
Glory to God in the highest
And peace to his people on earth. Thanks be to God
for his love beyond words. Amen.

Reading: John 15. 1 – 10 NIVUK read by Tony Hatton

trusting in your great love for us and for the world,
we offer our lives anew to you.
We recommit ourselves to walk the Way of Jesus,
to seek your will for our lives and for our world,
to pray and work for your kingdom of justice and joy.
By your Spirit, unite us and renew us,
that we may be channels of your love and peace,
through Jesus Christ our Saviour and Lord. Amen.
