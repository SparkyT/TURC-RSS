When the disciples returned to Jerusalem, they returned with joy knowing Jesus was with them

21:34 - Short Address – Praying the kingdom
We gather in our place of worship and homes just as the disciples did to pray together and praise the Lord.  
A disparate group of people, just Jews at the start then a growing group of Jews and Gentiles
Thinking of Jerusalem today, the suffering of the people in Israel and Palestine

06:13 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (an elder)

08:12 - Call to worship (based on Isaiah 60)
We are met in the presence of God;
and we do not meet alone.
With the Church throughout the world,
we gather to worship the Lord.
In Cathedrals, tin tabernacles and fields,
God’ holy name is praised. 
And here with our hearts and our voices,
God’ holy name is praised. 
We are met in the presence of God;
and we do not meet alone.

09:03 - Hymn R&amp;S 293  Ye servants of God

11:58 - Prayers of adoration and confession 
Lord’s Prayer 

14:21 - Introduction: ‘Jesus revealed’
Today is the second Sunday in Epiphany
Not as familiar as Easter or Lent but still one of the great seasons
Thinking about hidden things
Snowdrops, daffodils, the promise of things to come
Anyone can count the seeds in an apple but only God can count the number of apples in a seed
Jesus revealed
The wedding in Cana
6x 120 litres of wine!


22:41 - 24:10 - Reading: John 2. 1 – 11

24:12 - 26:03 - Prayer
When a daffodil or the first snowdrop comes into bloom:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When the sun is rising, or the sun is setting:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When a baby is born, or a chick is hatched:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When we feel the warm embrace of a family hug:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
When we come to worship or offer a prayer:
We catch a glimpse of God in the ordinary.
Transforming God, wherever we are, whatever we do,
whether we are at home, work or school,
help us to see the miracle in the ordinary,
and to catch a glimpse of your glory in our midst.  
Amen.

40:53 - Prayer
41:28 - 59:08 - Address : Today
Focusing on today in 3 different ways
This Sunday first marks the second Sunday of Epiphany with Jesus being revealed
John says not to get fixated on the details like the huge amount of wine, but to treat this as a sign of when glory was first revealed
Allow the story to reveal to you something extraordinary in the light of God's love
Corinthian Christians lived in an amazing and diverse court. They were sometimes carried away with religious fervour. 
Origins of the creed of the Christian church
This year may we continue to pray for unity in the Church of Christ

 But now thus says the Lord, 
 he who created you, O Jacob,
 he who formed you, O Israel:
 Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
 I have called you by name, you are mine.
 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
 and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;
 when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,
 and the flame shall not consume you.
 For I am the Lord your God,
 the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour.


21:07 - Hymn: R&amp;S 589  How firm a foundation

24:43 - Opening Prayers and the Lord’s Prayer

27:45 - 36:12 - Talk for all ages :  Life changing moments
How are you feeling this morning?  We all have ups and downs over time.
Sometimes we need things to lift us
Do you agree or disagree on these things that might lift you:
A good meal? A bar of chocolate? A run? A bottle of water?
Being with family
Pets
All of these things can lift us but they aren't permanent answers. We need something deeper to give us a boost when life changes direction.
Speaking to God and Him speaking to us
Looking at moments in Jesus' life - his baptism when God recognised him and sent him on into his ministry
Moments in his life when God speaks

 Junior Church: And also with you

44:25 - Introduction to Bible readings

45:55 - Reading: Luke 3: 15-22   read by John Hillson
15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 16 John answered them all, ‘I baptise you with[b] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptise you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire. 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.’ 18 And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.
19 But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done, 20 Herod added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.
21 When all the people were being baptised, Jesus was baptised too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened 22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: ‘You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.’



48:20 - Reading: Acts 8: 14-17  read by Sue Thorne
14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria. 15 When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 16 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

49:22 - Hymn:  R&amp;S 180  Before the world began


52:56 - 01:12:34 - Sermon:  We are loved 
We have God's affirmation of Christ at his baptism.
It's in all 4 gospels, two of which start with this story
John and Jesus were cousins, John just a few months older who as a young man went to live in the wilderness in very harsh conditions
John was preparing people for Jesus
The bible never suggests Jesus baptises with water, always with the laying on of hands
It always sounds simple - Jesus arrives, asks to be baptised, John is reluctant but agrees, performs the act, the spirit comes down.
Why did God choose this moment to speak
It contains much of the mystery and wonder of God
Why did Jesus need to be baptised?
Glimpses of hope and love all around us
We need to trust and look for God to find strength

Unconditional love
Archbishop Desmond Tutu speaking about respect and love for all

01:13:10 - Hymn:  R&amp;S 413  What a friend we have in Jesus

01:16:30 - 01:22:05 - Prayers for others and ourselves
Response:  Loving Lord,  we lift our prayers to you

01:22:08 - Hymn: R&amp;S 285  O for a thousand tongues to sing                       

01:25:54 - 01:26:12 - Closing blessing

18:27 - 23:50 - Introduction: Not over yet!
How many of you have taken down your Christmas decorations?
Anyone who didn't put up any decorations at all?
We take some down but keep the rest up until Epiphany
Some churches don't bring out the wise men in the nativity scene until Epiphany
Today is the 9th day of Christmas - 9 ladies dancing
According to some, each of the gifts represents a Christian truth.  Some believe this to be related to the 9 fruits of the spirit - Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, and Self-control
Starting anew, for ourselves and our world

23:52 - Reading: Matthew 2: 1 – 12 NIVUK 
27:32 - 29:06 - Poem ‘Don’t wait for an angel’ 

29:10 - Hymn 185 - Wise men seeking Jesus

33:02 - Reading: John 1. 10-18 NIVUK 

35:15 - 49:36 - Short Address 
Has anyone pulled a cracker this year? What local newspaper did Charles Dickens work on before he became famous?  Bicester Times and Worcester Times.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.
Set in the time of the French revolution with all its hopes and brutality and horrors
A time of enlightenment, rationality, revival, and John and Charles Wesley
We see all of these things, into this world comes the great affirmation of John's Gospel
Donald Rumsfeld and his unknown unknowns
&quot;Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.&quot;
Today there are many people who don't know God but they also don't know that they don't know Him.  Not a judgement, merely a statement of many people in the western world

49:51 - Hymn 395 - No one has ever seen God 
Time for quiet reflection and prayers for the world 

Offering the gifts of this last year and our lives for God’s work ahead – please stand for the Prayer of Dedication
Eternal God we come to you now 
 to offer the praise of our lips 
 and the service of our lives.
 We recommit ourselves 
 to walk the way of Jesus, 
 to seek your will for our lives and for our world.
 Unite us as one body in Christ, renew us by your Spirit, 
 that we may be true channels of your love and peace,
 through Jesus Christ our Saviour and Friend.  Amen.

57:02 - Song Jesu be the centre MP 1076 

59:15 - Communion: we invite you to share in the bread and wine at church (or at home) united in the name of Christ.

A Prayer of thanksgiving with the response
We thank you Lord of life And praise your holy name
Lord’s Prayer

10:40 - Hymn R&amp;S 134 On Jordan’s Banks the Baptist’s cry Tune: 537 Winchester new

13:00 - Opening Prayers

16:15 - Theme Introduction
Joy - not much of it around at the moment?
What might we be joyful about?
Printer paper being available
It's warmer
The fact we can still gather in person
A great view on a run
Thinking about what we can do to make others happy
Sharing a meal
Listening

21:05 - 21:45 - Prayer

21:47 - Lighting three candles on Advent crown

Let all who take refuge in God rejoice;
let them ever sing for joy. 

The candles are lit.
Jesus is the light of the world. 
A light no darkness can ever put out.
Will we be able to celebrate with our families this Christmas

23:10 - Song R&amp;S 522 From heaven you came, helpless babe

28:26 - 29:27 - Reading: Philippians 4.4-7 read by Aurelia Awuku

4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: rejoice! 5 Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

30:15 - Song R&amp;S 286 Rejoice in the Lord always (as a round)

33:26 - 36:01 - Reading:  Luke 3.7-18 read by Alan Yates

7 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptised by him, ‘You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, “We have Abraham as our father.” For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 9 The axe has been laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.’
10 ‘What should we do then?’ the crowd asked.
11 John answered, ‘Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.’
12 Even tax collectors came to be baptised. ‘Teacher,’ they asked, ‘what should we do?’
13 ‘Don’t collect any more than you are required to,’ he told them.
14 Then some soldiers asked him, ‘And what should we do?’

He replied, ‘Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely – be content with your pay.’
15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 16 John answered them all, ‘I baptise you with[b] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptise you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire. 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.’ 18 And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.

37:07 - Hymn R&amp;S 200 The kingdom of God Tune: (ii) Out Skerries

38:47 - 56:50 - Sermon What then should we do?
Here we are this morning hopefully alive and well.
Recent news of the meteor the size of the Eiffel tower skimming past the earth
Context is important though as it passed 2.4 million miles away
The gospel reading leaves us with an image of the sandwich board stating &quot;The end is nigh&quot;
If that's good news, what does bad news look like
Repentance is the foundation of the new kingdom
He who is faithful and just will forgive us of our sins
Repentance is about building a better world
Government parties around Christmas 2020 whilst the rest of the country was under restrictions
Saying sorry and resigning does show a level of repentance
When we get it wrong we need to hold up our hands and say sorry
Just saying sorry isn't the same as repentance
&quot;Turn around where possible&quot; from our sat-nav when we make a mistake

56:52 - Hymn MP 806 Beauty for brokenness

01:03:04 - Prayers of Intercession
Closing Prayers 

01:08:43 - Hymn R&amp;S 574 Go forth and tell Tune: 740 Woodlands

07:30 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle 

09:33 - Call to worship
Minister: In our watching and waiting:
All: Come, Lord Jesus.
Minister: In our hopes and fears:
All: Come, Lord Jesus.
Minister: In our stillness and worship:
All: Come, Lord Jesus.
Minister: Come, Lord Jesus, bless and surprise us
as we look forward to the celebration of your birth.

10:00 - Hymn 141 Make way, make way

13:06 - Opening Prayers

15:45 18:45 - Introduction: ‘Clear the way’
When cars were first introduced in this country, red flags were required to be carried in advance to clear the way and make sure all was safe
Clearing the way is a theme in Advent thinking about John the Baptist clearing the way for Jesus
John was a strange challenging figure
Looking at my bookshelf makes me thing I could do with clearing it somewhat
When they introduce John, the gospel writers use words from Isaiah


18:55 - Lighting two candles on Advent crown
Reader: We light our first candle, as a sign of our hope in
Jesus Christ. And we light the second candle to give
thanks for the Bible that is a light to guide and
inspire us:

All: God of hope, come to us again this Advent.
May your Word be a lamp to our feet
and a light on our path. Amen.

20:17 - Song MP 1086 Light of the world

23:03 - Introduction to the reading
Who knows where Malachi actually is in the bible?
It only appears once in the 3 year 
Malachi was the last of the 12 minor prophets and the last book in the old testament. From about 450 years before the birth of Christ
Malachi may not be the name of the writer of this book, &quot;malachi&quot; means messenger
The original words were arranged on a scroll by the ancient editor and as the words were a message, it's thought this led to the nickname
At his time he was exhorting people to change their ways, warning them of the judgement to come.

25:19 - 26:29 - Reading: Malachi 3. 1-4 NIVUK 
3 ‘I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me.
Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple;
the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,’ says
the LORD Almighty.
2  But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when
he appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s
soap.  3  He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify
the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the LORD will
have men who will bring offerings in righteousness,  4  and the
offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the LORD, as
in days gone by, as in former years.

Music for reflection (Be still for the presence of the Lord)

27:45 - 31:17 - Reading: Luke 3.1-6 NIVUK read by Olive Shepherd (seated)
3 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar – when
Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his
brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias
tetrarch of Abilene –  2  during the high-priesthood of Annas and
Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the
wilderness.  3  He went into all the country around the Jordan,
preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  4  As
it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:
‘A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
“Prepare the way for the Lord,
    make straight paths for him.
5  Every valley shall be filled in,
    every mountain and hill made low.
The crooked roads shall become straight,
    the rough ways smooth.

6  And all people will see God’s salvation.

31:25 - Hymn 137 Hark the glad sound

34:06 - Prayer
34:36 - 46:56 - Short Address
Are we prepared to be surprised this Advent season?
Ready to find God at work where we thought he was absent, to find him in unexpected places
Luke tells us to expect the unexpected
The reading starts with the messy world of politics and power
Luke reminds his readers who is in power
When he introduces John the Baptiser he also tells us who is in power
It's this messy, conflict ridden world that God sends his message into
So here we have a world of power, conflict and tension
We are then shifted to the wilderness, a place with no rules
God's power is very different to human power and authority
It brings transformation, hope and new beginnings

46:57 - 48:28 - Prayer
48:52 - Prayers for others

53:35 - Hymn MP 1201 Longing for light

58:10 Offering of bread and wine and Offering Prayer
We invite you to share in the bread and wine at church (or at
home) united in the name of Christ.
Thanksgiving Prayer and Lord’s Prayer
Distribution of bread and wine (Music during distribution)
Closing Prayers

01:07:28 - Hymn 740 - Tell out my soul

11:45 - Welcome and lighting of peace candle (elder)

12:46 - Introduction and Call to worship
Psalm 93 v 1-5
The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty;
the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength;
indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
Your throne was established long ago;
you are from all eternity.
The seas have lifted up, LORD,
the seas have lifted up their voice;
the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
Mightier than the thunder of the great waters,
mightier than the breakers of the sea –
the LORD on high is mighty.
Your statutes, LORD, stand firm;
holiness adorns your house
for endless days

15:07 - Hymn MP13 All hail the power of Jesus name

18:01 - Opening prayers and the Lord’s prayer

21:21 - Reading Revelation Ch 1 vv 4b – 8 

23:05 - 25:45 - Introduction to theme of the service
What if I told you that on this piece of paper I had every word in the bible, every word ever spoken?
God is like an A-Z, the beginning and end of everything
God has always been
God is at this very moment now
God will always be forever
God's kingdom is wherever Jesus reigns in our hearts

25:59 - Hymn MP 207 Hallelujah sing to Jesus

29:52 - 30:48 - Reading John18 vv 33b – 37 

Young people leave for their group

31:44 - Hymn R&amp;S 638 Thy kingdom come o God

34:25 - 48:13 - Address
Here we are at the end of another Christian church year
Next week is the start of advent
Today is when we remember Christ the King
This festival is not an ancient one in the calendar
Only established in 1925 by Pope Pious the 11th when Europe was in chaos, inflation was rampant and the seeds of the forthcoming disaster were being sowed
The conversation from John's reading allows John to pronounce that Jesus is a king with divine authority
Too often truth is often what power says it is
Jesus defied logic by the way he lived and taught
Teaching that truth is the cornerstone of a decent society

48:21 - Hymn R&amp;S 522 From heaven you came helpless babe

52:46 - Prayers of intercession

56:33 - Hymn R&amp;S 262 Crown him with many crowns

What was special about Sunday, 31st October, 2 weeks ago
A 25 hour day - what did you do with the additional hour?
Darker earlier in the day
Different shades of light and dark
Close your eyes and cover them to experience the darkness
Remembering the dark times of war

Being able to meet family again

46:18 - Prayer 
47:30 - 01:00:18 - Sermon – “Promises, promises!”
The gospel reading talks about war.
It follows on from Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem but we know it comes before the darkest of dark times when Jesus was crucified
The disciples comment to Jesus about how magnificent the temple stones were.
12m long, 4m deep and 6m high, huge pieces of stone that look as if they will be there for ever
Jesus disabuses the disciples of this saying the stones will collapse and every stone will be thrown down.
A shock to the disciples
Jesus is anticipating the destruction of Jerusalem in AD70
Jesus gives the disciples some of the signs of the end of the age
Jesus makes it clear that they should not worry but to watch and be prepared.
Promises made and promises kept?  Do our politicians keep their promises?
COP26 in Glasgow, what promises have been made and which will be kept
Greta Thunberg and &quot;Blah, blah, blah&quot;

Praise the LORD, my soul.

The Lord is the Maker of heaven and earth,

God remains faithful for ever.

17:19 - 23:43 - Introduction: ‘Not to be forgotten’

A glorious autumn day, the leaves are falling but taking their time
A month of remembering
Remembering and forgetting
Every piece matters
A community of faith
A challenge - remembering the people who feel forgotten
Those who died in conflict
The planet on which we depend
No-one if forgotten by God
The ribbons from the gate to remember loved ones

Today we have heard familiar readings

Stretch your mind across the amazing universe which we are discovering more about but still have so much to find; across this planet with all the diverse species

We cannot do it on our own, we need the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
