   <media:description>Reading: James 1. 17 â€“ 27 NIVUK

Short Address:
Martin Luther had a low opinion of the letter of James and would have happily torn it from the bible
He thought James was relying on actions at the expense of faith
&quot;Every good and perfect gift comes from above&quot;
Perhaps God's greatest gift is God - unchangeable, faithful, dependable, always present.
So much is changing in our world and personal lives.  God is constant, full of light, full of love.
James has a desire for integrity in the followers of Jesus

   <media:description>Saying Rabbits on the first day of the month
We will focus on the letter from James throughout August
James is a popular name today and was in the 1st Century as well
This is not a normal letter in the traditional sense such as the ones Paul wrote
There is a short greeting and then a collection of sermons, sayings, and teaching
It is addressed to the 12 tribes, scattered amongst the nations
A scattered church under pressure, wrestling with the problems of their time
&quot;Find joy in the midst of pressures&quot;
As we explore the letter, we ask for God's help, inspiration, and blessing

   <media:description>Reading: Philippians 1.3-11 NIVUK

A short prayer
Short Address:
Tomorrow was the day we had been waiting for for many months - the end of legal restrictions in the UK
The restrictions may be going but the concern for one another and how the virus will play out continue
How can we best care for each other in the months ahead
It's clear that we need to continue to love each other in this practical way of keeping each other safe
Can Paul help give us perspective on the situation we face - he was writing to the Church in Philippi from a position of total lockdown whilst imprisoned
5 key phrases from lockdown Paul
- A word of thanks
- Partnership
- Love
- Discernment
- Assurance

   <media:description>Repair shop â€“ â€˜Making the church work todayâ€™
There is something very satisfying about repairing something
Something precious that you have mended
The repair job is not just of objects but there is a sense of families being restored as their treasured possessions are returned to them made new
In a sense, Church is about repairing souls, being renewed.
We have been through challenging times in the past 18 months
May we be a repair shop for others, repairing others, renewing lives and helping all to know the life that God wants for us

Reading: Genesis 18.1- 10 Good News

A moment of reflection
Sarah laughs at the unexpected news that she is to have a child
The act of hospitality in the reading where God appears to Abraham

How do we make peace with the planet as God's followers?

2. What can we do? Small actions/ changes  â€“ Video by Junior Church leaders.

What can we do to challenge the Government to play its part?
What can we do? Petition government â€“ Video on the effects of climate change globally

Please consider signing the Reboot petition arranged by Tearfund or the similar petition arranged by the Climate Coalition.   It has these words

Declaration: the Time Is Now  https://thetimeisnow.uk/ 

Dear Prime Minister,
The time is now to lead the UK towards a healthier, greener, fairer future. Ahead of hosting the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, we can build back better together if we:
â€¢ Unleash a clean energy revolution that boosts jobs across the UK, making our transport, power and housing fit for the future
â€¢ Protect, restore and expand our green and wild spaces; allowing nature to thrive, taking carbon from the air and boosting the nationâ€™s health
â€¢ Leave no one behind by increasing support to those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change at home and abroad
The UK must lead the world by ensuring our recovery gets us on track to net-zero emissions and limits the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees C. Our best chance of building a resilient economy goes hand in hand with tackling climate change.
We are ready to play our part, and we call on you to join us.

What can we do? Pray

   <media:description>Introduction: Climate Sunday â€“ time to worship, commit and speak up
Climate Sunday marked in different ways before September before the big Nation's service in Glasgow in September before the Glasgow COPA26 conference
Thanks to Junior Church Leaders for their help with the service this morning
How are we going to better care for our planet, better play our part within the incredible complexity of creation

Readings Genesis 2. 8 â€“ 15  (Good News) 

All age talk â€“ looking after the garden
Over this past year people have valued their gardens or house plants. 
Linking them to nature and providing perspective when the world has felt a very uncertain and frightening place
A garden or green space can be a place of refreshment or simply being
No surprise that the picture God gives to us of our relationship with the planet is a garden
It's our responsibility to look after our planet

1. What can we do? Be aware of the damage we have done.

   <media:description>Reading: 2 Corinthians 5. 14 â€“ 20 

Short Address: â€˜The message of reconciliationâ€™ 
It's as if God were making his appeal through us
It's as if God were extending the olive branch to each of us and our broken world
Forgiving the past and inviting us to be whole again
For Paul the Jew who had experienced the love of Christ, that love had sent him out to meet people who before he would have dismissed as outside God's concern or care.
The message had not only touched him but transformed his view of humanity
Reaching out and not counting people's sins against them regardless of situation
That reconciliation is not just between God and the world but between people.
God has entrusted us with a ministry of reconciliation to bring all of humanity together.  
It's that universal but how are we to be part of that today?
Look around the world for examples, Northern Ireland, South Africa.
Let us pray for our role as we try to live out as peacemakers today

Prayer for peace

   <media:description>Introduction of the theme of peace â€“ the olive branch
The focus of our prayers today are the Holy Land for peace between Israeli and Palestinian alike
Something we know is incredibly difficult and has been since the birth of the state of Israel
We are torn between all of the injustices of the past and pray for a reconciliation and and end to conflict
We came back from holiday and the olive tree in the pot at home was beginning to bud.
This branch has been a symbol of peace for so many years


Update on Commitment for Life projects in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and present situation (Angus Massie)

Prayer:
Pray not for Arab or Jew, 
for Palestinian or Israeli 
But pray rather for ourselves
That we might not divide them in our prayers.
But keep them together in our hearts.

Reading Psalm 46 NIVUK

   <media:description>Reading Mark 5. 21 â€“ 43 Sue up to v34 Marian 35-43

Introduction to the talk - Culture and Crowd
I originally watched a Euro football match between Hungary and Portugal and it felt very strange seeing a full stadium
Long lens photos in the news that make beaches look crowded during the pandemic
Crowds are part of our culture, Donald Trump and the inauguration crowds and those at his rallies
It will be strange when we get back after social distancing
Crowds give a feeling of anonymity
In the readings, crowds feature strongly
Jesus is busy teaching but is interrupted by a synagogue ruler
Jesus is then interrupted by the woman who has been suffering for years
Both had heard about Jesus and believed he could help
Jesus doesn't need celebrity endorsements

Thoughts on the talk 
Music for reflection and three questions for personal reflection 
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds R&amp;S 277 2nd tune St Peter Organ
1. Where am I in the crowd?
2. Is it me who wants to reach out to Jesus for his touch today?
3. Am I to be Jesus' hands and feet to server others?

   <media:description>Peace-less fear in the previous example
Fear and peace can be seen as opposites so fearless peace could be considered tautologous
Another example remembering my first driving test
Both brothers had already passed and I was terrified of failing, being convinced after the emergency stop that I had failed but after this, I relaxed and with no fear left, relaxed and passed.
I thank the Lord that the rockets fired across the Israel Palestine border have ceased, fear has not ceased though.
Lake Galilee and the topology that funnels the wind into ferocious squalls
Understandable that the disciples felt a shiver of fear
As we read the story from Mark, we can understand a little of what Christ can bring to us
Any journey with Christ is to journey in peace
Paul's second list of 9 is a list of equipment to survive in Christian life
Paul's reference to children &quot;I speak as to my children&quot; in the final verse has a tinge of insult about it - is Paul really implying his fellow disciples are immature and foolish?

   <media:description>- I'm pleased that with my increasing age, I'm no longer the youngest in the congregation
 -I want to give an example of absolute fear on the water.  
- Being in Wales on holiday at one of the best wind-surfing sites in Dale in Pembrokeshire for intermediate surfers
- Beaufort scale - wind surf boards can get to 3-4 times the wind speed
- Wind speed was gusting to 25 mph 
- I decided to surf to the next bay only a mine so it should have taken 15 minutes or less
- As soon as I got beyond the peak, the winds were gusting to scale 7 and I could hardly stand up, being tossed into the water over and over again
- I was so exhausted I said a prayer and determined that if I fell in again I would have to try and swim for the shore
- I miraculously made it to the beach in one go on the next attempt
- This reminds us not to rely on our own strength - Christ is always with you

   <media:description>Reading: Mark 10.13 â€“ 16 Jesus and the children

2nd Reflection: â€˜Ready to receive?â€™ 
- Have you got the time
- The disciples assume Jesus doesn't have the time for the children and their mothers
- Surely Jesus has more important things to do?
- The children is precisely what the Kingdom of God is about
- We can't earn the blessing, we have to accept it as a gift
- The Kingdom of God is a gift, nothing to do with our endeavours to improve our intellects, CVs etc.
- Are we ready to receive like the children
- Jesus tells his disciples to learn from the children who were coming to Jesus to be blessed.
- Are we willing to do that today?

Reading: 1 Corinthians 10.23-26 Receiving Christ

   <media:description>00:00:00 - Reading: Ecclesiastes 3. 1 â€“ 8 A time for everything
- What time is it for you at this moment in your lives?
- Just as we emerge from lockdown again with cautious hugs we need to decide when it is right to open up again
- Remembering gardening, planting and nurturing, pruning and digging up.
- Times when we encourage growth and times when we battle slugs
- What time is it for you?
- Leading worship at Trinity, time is always on one's mind with the need to rush back to Cores End for their service
- Using our time well
- The reading assures us there is a time for everything
- God has given us time to give and a time to receive
- A common funeral prayer - God our creator.... just as at our birth you are there when we pass.
- Do we have to reach out and accept help from others
- Talk to people
